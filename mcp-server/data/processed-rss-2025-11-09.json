        "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $228 at Amazon\n $329.99 $228 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $89 at Nothing\n $109 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)\nThe second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExceptional ANC\nSecure fit\nWireless charging case\n\nBulky design\nMerely average battery life\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Bose\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\nRead our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah! Wireless charging!\nAdds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio\nSlimmer ear hook, smaller case\nAdds heart rate\nGreat sound\nNo price hike\n\nCase is still a chonker\nHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features last year. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, in combination with better ANC performance, give the AirPods Pro 3 the best overall noise canceling from a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is incredibly close to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (although some people might not even notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, which we first saw with the Powerbeats Pro 2 last winter, enables heart rate tracking for 50 different types of workouts directly from the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. \nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $169 at Amazon\n $229 $169 at Best Buy\n $229 $169 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $149.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $149.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $299.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $299.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to add the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) and Apple AirPods Pro 3 as picks, and to reflect current pricing / availability.",

        "description": "The Apple Watch SE 3 has dropped to its best price to date in several configurations.\t\n\nHey, all! The first week of November ushered in dozens of early Black Friday deals, and many of the best ones are still available as we delve further into the weekend. Some of our favorite fitness trackers have already plunged to new lows, for instance, and we’re even seeing early discounts on holiday decor. We’ve already published a full list of early Black Friday deals, which we aim to update on a weekly basis, but below is a quick overview of this week’s cream of the crop — including a few standouts that have nothing to do with the annual shopping event.\nIt’s possible that the Apple Watch SE 3 will drop further in price once Black Friday officially kicks off, but if you don’t feel like waiting, the 40mm / GPS configuration is already down to $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Costco. That’s a new low on Apple’s latest smartwatch, which is a great value even at full price; however, note that the current Amazon promo only applies to the cream-colored “starlight” model.\nFor an entry-level wearable, the SE 3 offers several impressive features. It features an always-on display — a first for Apple’s cheaper SE lineup — and runs on the same snappy S10 chip found in the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3. That means, in addition to better performance, you’ll be able to take advantage of some of Apple’s more unique features, including on-device Siri and the new wrist flick gesture. You also get health and wellness features that were previously limited to more expensive models, including sleep apnea notifications, a wrist-temperature sensor, and ovulation tracking. Some features, such as EKG readings and blood oxygen measurements, are still reserved for the Series 11, but sacrifices are expected at this price.\nRead our Apple Watch SE 3 review.\nApple Watch SE 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199.99 at Amazon (40mm, GPS)\n $279 $229.99 at Amazon (44mm, GPS)\n $249 $199.99 at Costco (40mm, GPS)\n\nIf you’re planning to spend Thanksgiving binging the latest season of Stranger Things like me, Google’s TV Streamer (4K) allows you to experience The Upside Down in crisp, 4K resolution. And right now, it’s available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google for an all-time low of $74.99 ($25 off).\nGoogle’s latest set-top box can make your favorite shows and movies sharper and more immersive, thanks to its support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos audio. Its interface can pull content recommendations across streaming services — with Rotten Tomatoes scores — and it comes with a handy Find My feature for the remote, which lets you ping the clicker via the streaming box should you ever misplace it. The Google TV Streamer (4K) even doubles as a smart home hub with Matter and Thread support, allowing you to control your smart lights or check various camera feeds directly on your TV.\nRead our full Google TV Streamer (4K) review.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $74.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $74.99 at Best Buy\n $99.99 $74.99 at Google\n\nIf you’re already feeling the holiday spirit, Lego’s 2025 Star Wars Advent Calendar is on sale at Target for $26.99 ($18 off), which is its best price to date. The 263-piece kit includes 24 daily surprises for each day of December, with a mix of minifigures, buildable droids, and small set pieces. It includes characters like Babu Frik, C-3PO, a holiday Jawa, and hat-topped BB-8, along with eight buildable droids (including a pit droid and the infamous GNK “Gonk” power droid from 1977’s A New Hope). Some of the mini builds come together to form larger displays, too, meaning as the month goes on, you’ll be slowly assembling a workshop. Plus, once you’re finished, all the figures and builds can be combined with other Lego sets.\nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $26.99 at Target\n $44.99 at Lego\n\nThree more of this week’s best deals\nSamsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon, which is a small discount but the best we’ve seen. The card lets you store all of your digital Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 titles, but you can also use it to expand storage on certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. It supports sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, although only devices with a dedicated microSD Express slot can take advantage of the maximum speeds.\nThe Anker 521 PowerHouse is on sale for an all-time low of $128.99 at Amazon at checkout, down from $249.99. The 256Wh power station features two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet, letting you recharge phones, cameras, and laptops several times over. It can also run power-hungry devices that draw up to 300W of power, including mini fridges, and comes with a useful display that shows you how much power you have left.\nSamsung’s 65-inch Frame Pro TV is down to an all-time low of $1,447.99 ($752 off) at Woot through December 6th, while the larger 75-inch model can be had for $1,897.99 ($1,302 off). Like the standard Frame, the Frame Pro displays artwork when idle, so it looks like wall decor; however, it’s noticeably brighter and comes with a faster 144Hz refresh rate, along with a wireless One Connect Box to keep cable clutter out of sight.

        "description": "In 2025, you might wonder if Fitbit is still relevant. Despite being acquired by Google, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics, like EKGs and blood oxygen levels.\nThat said, we’re still in the transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. We’re further away from 2023, which was a particularly messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to sunset legacy community features — including challenges — or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will require you to log in via Google beginning in February 2026. \nSpeaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration started in 2023 and is required if you buy the Fitbit Charge 6 or the Google Pixel Watch 4. The Fitbit app also got a more Google-like makeover, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And last year, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company as roughly a thousand Google employees were laid off. Now, in 2025, most of Google’s focus seems to be on its own smartwatches. \nThe Googlefication of Fitbit will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale. All the devices also come with a free trial to Fitbit Premium, the company’s subscription service that provides guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. The service costs $9.99 per month, or $79.88 per year. And with the launch of the Pixel Watch 4 in October, it’s clear that Google is taking its wearables seriously as well. The new smartwatch features longer-lasting battery life, a more repairable design, and compatibility with Fitbit’s AI-powered fitness coach. You just have to go in with eyes wide open.\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nGoogle Pixel Watch 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAll-around better battery and fast-charging\nMaterial 3 Expressive design refresh is smart\nBetter auto activity tracking\nRaise-to-Talk is quite natural\nDomed display looks quite nice\nRepairability!\nSatellite SOS\n\nThird proprietary charger in four years\nGemini is still hit or miss\nGPS maps are better, but still a bit wonky\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Google (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Amazon (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Best Buy (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 doesn’t have “Fitbit” in its title, but it falls under the same umbrella because of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. The fourth-gen watch is a significant update over its predecessors, with a handsome domed display and thinner bezels that increase screen real estate. The watch’s updated design allows you to swap out the display or battery, if necessary, and we were able to eke out between 36 and 42 hours of battery life in our testing, up from 32 hours on the Pixel Watch 3. We also saw a notable uptick in charging speed, allowing us to take the watch from 14 to 97 percent in just 44 minutes using Google’s new proprietary charger.\nThe hardware upgrades work in tandem with Wear OS 6, which introduces a complete redesign with Material 3 Expressive and brings Gemini to Google’s latest wearable. A new raise-to-talk feature lets you access the smart assistant without saying “Hey Google” or pushing a button, while new AI features such as Notification Cooldown and Smart Replies — which let you compose personalized replies to incoming messages if you have a newer Pixel phone — put even more functionality on your wrist. Gemini in Wear OS 6 is somewhat hit or miss, to be sure, but the redesign complements the Pixel Watch 4’s size and shape really well.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 can automatically track a limited number of exercises, allowing you to accurately record your walks, runs, and cycling sessions. Its dual-band GPS was better at tracking runs than the Pixel Watch 3 in our initial tests, but it couldn’t quite keep up with Apple’s pricier Watch Ultra 3. That said, both LTE models share the ability to send an emergency SOS via satellite when you’re in a remote area with no signal. The Pixel Watch 4’s mix of hardware, features, and price make it the best Fitbit, and one of the top Android watches overall.\nIf all you want is a fitness tracker that looks like a smartwatch, you can consider the $199.95 Versa 4 since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the Sense 2 since the Pixel Watch 4 can do all the same things — and more.\nRead my full Pixel Watch 4 review.\nBest budget Fitbit\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood entry-level fitness & sleep tracker\nBright OLED display\nLightweight\n\n\nHuge bezels\nLimited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.95 $69.95 at Amazon\n $99.95 $69.95 at Best Buy\n $99.95 $69.95 at Google\n\nThe Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, inspired. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the Fitbit Luxe of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.\nThe Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.) \nThe Inspire 3 has a variety of accessories, including a clip attachment if you want to track steps discreetly. There’s even a gold or silver mesh strap if you want to dress it up a bit. \nRead our coverage of the Fitbit Inspire 3 here.\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nFitbit Charge 6\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSolid fitness and health tracking feature set\nIt’s $20 cheaper!\nAdds more apps\nCan broadcast HR to fitness equipment\nThe haptic button is better than the groove\n\nYouTube Music is the only option and that’s $11 monthly\nThe Fitbit-Google transition is a lil bumpy\nIt’s not a physical side button\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $159.95 $99.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $99.95 at Google\n\nThe Charge series has always been popular, and the $159.95 Charge 6 is no exception. It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive Versa 4 on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.\nThe only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.\nAltogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, Sense 2, Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Watch 4. So, unless you’re dead set on the smartwatch form factor, the Charge 6 is the better overall deal. \nCompared to its predecessor, the Charge 6 also adds an improved heart rate algorithm, Bluetooth compatibility with some gym equipment, and a few apps — namely Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music. While YouTube Music works well, I’m not stoked that it requires an additional $10.99 monthly subscription. That said, it’s better than nothing, as Fitbit discontinued onboard music a while back.\nIn terms of hardware, the Charge 6 also features a haptic button instead of an inductive groove. It’s not a physical button, which is a little disappointing, but it’s more reliable thus far than the inductive groove, so I would count this as a net positive.\nRead our Fitbit Charge 6 review.\nBest Fitbit for kids\nFitbit Ace LTE\nThe Ace LTE sports some of the same hardware found on the Pixel Watch 2 and a variety of step-activated games, which can help motivate your child to keep moving. It also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing when you sign up for a monthly or annual data plan.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat build quality for a kids’ watch\nCross platform\nFun games that require physical activity to unlock\nVoice calls and text messaging with preselected contacts\nFamily group chat\n\nYou’ll have to charge it every night\nOnly two color options (but multiple band options)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $99.95 at Amazon\n $179.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 $99.99 at Google\n\nThe $179.99 Fitbit Ace LTE isn’t really a traditional fitness tracker, though it does track active minutes. Instead, it’s a smartwatch with a mix of kid-friendly games and activities and thoughtful, family-oriented communication features. It’s a walled garden, but an adorable one.\nInstead of rigorously tracking health stats, the Ace LTE tracks “active minutes,” which fill a cute progress meter called a Noodle that runs around the face of the watch. Active minutes earn time with the Ace LTE’s built-in games that, combined with activities, unlock customizations for your kid’s avatar (called an Eejie) that lives in the watch, as well as its little house. You can also unlock different games and virtual items by connecting different watch straps.\nWith a $10/month subscription, you get real-time location tracking and both voice and text messaging to preselected contacts through the Fitbit Ace app (rather than the standard messaging and phone apps). As of November 2024, that includes other family members with Ace LTE watches, as well as a family group chat between parents and kids.\nI like that the Ace LTE is built more like a cross-platform smartwatch for adults than other kid watches we’ve used, like the plasticky Garmin Bounce. It uses the same charger as the Pixel Watch 3, and gets about a day’s worth of battery on a charge. My kids enjoy it but aren’t obsessed with it — though they have been known to run laps up and down the hallway to earn more game time. \nGoogle says the Ace LTE is best suited for kids aged 7 to 11, and that sounds right. My oldest is 10 now, and she’s been using an Ace LTE for about a year. Once she hits middle school, I think she’ll be frustrated that she can’t use it to talk to her friends. But for now, it’s great. We recently got one for our 8-year-old, and it’s wild that they can text each other from their watches. It also means my 8-year-old can spam the group chat with emoji, but that’s fine too. \n— Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nRead our hands-on with the Fitbit Ace LTE.\nShould you even buy a Fitbit right now?\nFitbit officially became part of Google in 2021. Nothing changed overnight, but technically, it’s Fitbit by Google now. The Fitbit-to-Google migration started in the summer of 2023, and account migration will be mandatory — not merely optional — for all users in early 2026. Google angered longtime Fitbit users by shuttering social features like challenges and removing streaks, though the latter returned a few months later. In early 2024 Google laid off roughly a thousand employees from its hardware departments, including people on the Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest teams.\nIn early 2025, Google released a mandatory software update for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense users to “reduce the risk of battery overheating,” which had the unfortunate side effect of reducing battery life from as many as six days to as few as one for some users. However, the fact that we’re getting a significantly redesigned Fitbit app and an AI-powered health coach does show that Google is still investing resources in projects under the Fitbit name. The hardware improvements introduced with the Pixel Watch 4 are also a positive sign that Google remains committed to developing compelling wearable hardware. \nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.

        "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $228 at Amazon\n $329.99 $228 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow.

But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)\nThe second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExceptional ANC\nSecure fit\nWireless charging case\n\nBulky design\nMerely average battery life\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Bose\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\nRead our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah! Wireless charging!\nAdds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio\nSlimmer ear hook, smaller case\nAdds heart rate\nGreat sound\nNo price hike\n\nCase is still a chonker\nHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features last year. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, in combination with better ANC performance, give the AirPods Pro 3 the best overall noise canceling from a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is incredibly close to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (although some people might not even notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, which we first saw with the Powerbeats Pro 2 last winter, enables heart rate tracking for 50 different types of workouts directly from the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. \nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $169 at Amazon\n $229 $169 at Best Buy\n $229 $169 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $149.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $149.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $299.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $299.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to add the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) and Apple AirPods Pro 3 as picks, and to reflect current pricing / availability.",

        "description": "The Apple Watch SE 3 has dropped to its best price to date in several configurations.\t\n\nHey, all! The first week of November ushered in dozens of early Black Friday deals, and many of the best ones are still available as we delve further into the weekend. Some of our favorite fitness trackers have already plunged to new lows, for instance, and we’re even seeing early discounts on holiday decor. We’ve already published a full list of early Black Friday deals, which we aim to update on a weekly basis, but below is a quick overview of this week’s cream of the crop — including a few standouts that have nothing to do with the annual shopping event.\nIt’s possible that the Apple Watch SE 3 will drop further in price once Black Friday officially kicks off, but if you don’t feel like waiting, the 40mm / GPS configuration is already down to $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Costco. That’s a new low on Apple’s latest smartwatch, which is a great value even at full price; however, note that the current Amazon promo only applies to the cream-colored “starlight” model.\nFor an entry-level wearable, the SE 3 offers several impressive features. It features an always-on display — a first for Apple’s cheaper SE lineup — and runs on the same snappy S10 chip found in the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3. That means, in addition to better performance, you’ll be able to take advantage of some of Apple’s more unique features, including on-device Siri and the new wrist flick gesture. You also get health and wellness features that were previously limited to more expensive models, including sleep apnea notifications, a wrist-temperature sensor, and ovulation tracking. Some features, such as EKG readings and blood oxygen measurements, are still reserved for the Series 11, but sacrifices are expected at this price.\nRead our Apple Watch SE 3 review.\nApple Watch SE 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199.99 at Amazon (40mm, GPS)\n $279 $229.99 at Amazon (44mm, GPS)\n $249 $199.99 at Costco (40mm, GPS)\n\nIf you’re planning to spend Thanksgiving binging the latest season of Stranger Things like me, Google’s TV Streamer (4K) allows you to experience The Upside Down in crisp, 4K resolution. And right now, it’s available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google for an all-time low of $74.99 ($25 off).\nGoogle’s latest set-top box can make your favorite shows and movies sharper and more immersive, thanks to its support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos audio. Its interface can pull content recommendations across streaming services — with Rotten Tomatoes scores — and it comes with a handy Find My feature for the remote, which lets you ping the clicker via the streaming box should you ever misplace it. The Google TV Streamer (4K) even doubles as a smart home hub with Matter and Thread support, allowing you to control your smart lights or check various camera feeds directly on your TV.\nRead our full Google TV Streamer (4K) review.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $74.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $74.99 at Best Buy\n $99.99 $74.99 at Google\n\nIf you’re already feeling the holiday spirit, Lego’s 2025 Star Wars Advent Calendar is on sale at Target for $26.99 ($18 off), which is its best price to date. The 263-piece kit includes 24 daily surprises for each day of December, with a mix of minifigures, buildable droids, and small set pieces. It includes characters like Babu Frik, C-3PO, a holiday Jawa, and hat-topped BB-8, along with eight buildable droids (including a pit droid and the infamous GNK “Gonk” power droid from 1977’s A New Hope). Some of the mini builds come together to form larger displays, too, meaning as the month goes on, you’ll be slowly assembling a workshop. Plus, once you’re finished, all the figures and builds can be combined with other Lego sets.\nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $26.99 at Target\n $44.99 at Lego\n\nThree more of this week’s best deals\nSamsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon, which is a small discount but the best we’ve seen. The card lets you store all of your digital Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 titles, but you can also use it to expand storage on certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. It supports sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, although only devices with a dedicated microSD Express slot can take advantage of the maximum speeds.\nThe Anker 521 PowerHouse is on sale for an all-time low of $128.99 at Amazon at checkout, down from $249.99. The 256Wh power station features two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet, letting you recharge phones, cameras, and laptops several times over. It can also run power-hungry devices that draw up to 300W of power, including mini fridges, and comes with a useful display that shows you how much power you have left.\nSamsung’s 65-inch Frame Pro TV is down to an all-time low of $1,447.99 ($752 off) at Woot through December 6th, while the larger 75-inch model can be had for $1,897.99 ($1,302 off). Like the standard Frame, the Frame Pro displays artwork when idle, so it looks like wall decor; however, it’s noticeably brighter and comes with a faster 144Hz refresh rate, along with a wireless One Connect Box to keep cable clutter out of sight.

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker",
        "description": "In 2025, you might wonder if Fitbit is still relevant. Despite being acquired by Google, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics, like EKGs and blood oxygen levels.\nThat said, we’re still in the transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. We’re further away from 2023, which was a particularly messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to sunset legacy community features — including challenges — or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will require you to log in via Google beginning in February 2026. \nSpeaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration started in 2023 and is required if you buy the Fitbit Charge 6 or the Google Pixel Watch 4. The Fitbit app also got a more Google-like makeover, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And last year, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company as roughly a thousand Google employees were laid off. Now, in 2025, most of Google’s focus seems to be on its own smartwatches. \nThe Googlefication of Fitbit will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale. All the devices also come with a free trial to Fitbit Premium, the company’s subscription service that provides guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. The service costs $9.99 per month, or $79.88 per year. And with the launch of the Pixel Watch 4 in October, it’s clear that Google is taking its wearables seriously as well. The new smartwatch features longer-lasting battery life, a more repairable design, and compatibility with Fitbit’s AI-powered fitness coach. You just have to go in with eyes wide open.\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nGoogle Pixel Watch 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAll-around better battery and fast-charging\nMaterial 3 Expressive design refresh is smart\nBetter auto activity tracking\nRaise-to-Talk is quite natural\nDomed display looks quite nice\nRepairability!\nSatellite SOS\n\nThird proprietary charger in four years\nGemini is still hit or miss\nGPS maps are better, but still a bit wonky\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Google (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Amazon (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Best Buy (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 doesn’t have “Fitbit” in its title, but it falls under the same umbrella because of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. The fourth-gen watch is a significant update over its predecessors, with a handsome domed display and thinner bezels that increase screen real estate. The watch’s updated design allows you to swap out the display or battery, if necessary, and we were able to eke out between 36 and 42 hours of battery life in our testing, up from 32 hours on the Pixel Watch 3. We also saw a notable uptick in charging speed, allowing us to take the watch from 14 to 97 percent in just 44 minutes using Google’s new proprietary charger.\nThe hardware upgrades work in tandem with Wear OS 6, which introduces a complete redesign with Material 3 Expressive and brings Gemini to Google’s latest wearable. A new raise-to-talk feature lets you access the smart assistant without saying “Hey Google” or pushing a button, while new AI features such as Notification Cooldown and Smart Replies — which let you compose personalized replies to incoming messages if you have a newer Pixel phone — put even more functionality on your wrist. Gemini in Wear OS 6 is somewhat hit or miss, to be sure, but the redesign complements the Pixel Watch 4’s size and shape really well.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 can automatically track a limited number of exercises, allowing you to accurately record your walks, runs, and cycling sessions. Its dual-band GPS was better at tracking runs than the Pixel Watch 3 in our initial tests, but it couldn’t quite keep up with Apple’s pricier Watch Ultra 3. That said, both LTE models share the ability to send an emergency SOS via satellite when you’re in a remote area with no signal. The Pixel Watch 4’s mix of hardware, features, and price make it the best Fitbit, and one of the top Android watches overall.\nIf all you want is a fitness tracker that looks like a smartwatch, you can consider the $199.95 Versa 4 since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the Sense 2 since the Pixel Watch 4 can do all the same things — and more.\nRead my full Pixel Watch 4 review.\nBest budget Fitbit\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood entry-level fitness & sleep tracker\nBright OLED display\nLightweight\n\n\nHuge bezels\nLimited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.95 $69.95 at Amazon\n $99.95 $69.95 at Best Buy\n $99.95 $69.95 at Google\n\nThe Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, inspired. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the Fitbit Luxe of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.\nThe Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.) \nThe Inspire 3 has a variety of accessories, including a clip attachment if you want to track steps discreetly. There’s even a gold or silver mesh strap if you want to dress it up a bit. \nRead our coverage of the Fitbit Inspire 3 here.\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nFitbit Charge 6\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSolid fitness and health tracking feature set\nIt’s $20 cheaper!\nAdds more apps\nCan broadcast HR to fitness equipment\nThe haptic button is better than the groove\n\nYouTube Music is the only option and that’s $11 monthly\nThe Fitbit-Google transition is a lil bumpy\nIt’s not a physical side button\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $159.95 $99.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $99.95 at Google\n\nThe Charge series has always been popular, and the $159.95 Charge 6 is no exception. It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive Versa 4 on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.\nThe only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.\nAltogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, Sense 2, Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Watch 4. So, unless you’re dead set on the smartwatch form factor, the Charge 6 is the better overall deal. \nCompared to its predecessor, the Charge 6 also adds an improved heart rate algorithm, Bluetooth compatibility with some gym equipment, and a few apps — namely Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music. While YouTube Music works well, I’m not stoked that it requires an additional $10.99 monthly subscription. That said, it’s better than nothing, as Fitbit discontinued onboard music a while back.\nIn terms of hardware, the Charge 6 also features a haptic button instead of an inductive groove. It’s not a physical button, which is a little disappointing, but it’s more reliable thus far than the inductive groove, so I would count this as a net positive.\nRead our Fitbit Charge 6 review.\nBest Fitbit for kids\nFitbit Ace LTE\nThe Ace LTE sports some of the same hardware found on the Pixel Watch 2 and a variety of step-activated games, which can help motivate your child to keep moving. It also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing when you sign up for a monthly or annual data plan.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat build quality for a kids’ watch\nCross platform\nFun games that require physical activity to unlock\nVoice calls and text messaging with preselected contacts\nFamily group chat\n\nYou’ll have to charge it every night\nOnly two color options (but multiple band options)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $99.95 at Amazon\n $179.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 $99.99 at Google\n\nThe $179.99 Fitbit Ace LTE isn’t really a traditional fitness tracker, though it does track active minutes. Instead, it’s a smartwatch with a mix of kid-friendly games and activities and thoughtful, family-oriented communication features. It’s a walled garden, but an adorable one.\nInstead of rigorously tracking health stats, the Ace LTE tracks “active minutes,” which fill a cute progress meter called a Noodle that runs around the face of the watch. Active minutes earn time with the Ace LTE’s built-in games that, combined with activities, unlock customizations for your kid’s avatar (called an Eejie) that lives in the watch, as well as its little house. You can also unlock different games and virtual items by connecting different watch straps.\nWith a $10/month subscription, you get real-time location tracking and both voice and text messaging to preselected contacts through the Fitbit Ace app (rather than the standard messaging and phone apps). As of November 2024, that includes other family members with Ace LTE watches, as well as a family group chat between parents and kids.\nI like that the Ace LTE is built more like a cross-platform smartwatch for adults than other kid watches we’ve used, like the plasticky Garmin Bounce. It uses the same charger as the Pixel Watch 3, and gets about a day’s worth of battery on a charge. My kids enjoy it but aren’t obsessed with it — though they have been known to run laps up and down the hallway to earn more game time. \nGoogle says the Ace LTE is best suited for kids aged 7 to 11, and that sounds right. My oldest is 10 now, and she’s been using an Ace LTE for about a year. Once she hits middle school, I think she’ll be frustrated that she can’t use it to talk to her friends. But for now, it’s great. We recently got one for our 8-year-old, and it’s wild that they can text each other from their watches. It also means my 8-year-old can spam the group chat with emoji, but that’s fine too. \n— Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nRead our hands-on with the Fitbit Ace LTE.\nShould you even buy a Fitbit right now?\nFitbit officially became part of Google in 2021. Nothing changed overnight, but technically, it’s Fitbit by Google now. The Fitbit-to-Google migration started in the summer of 2023, and account migration will be mandatory — not merely optional — for all users in early 2026. Google angered longtime Fitbit users by shuttering social features like challenges and removing streaks, though the latter returned a few months later. In early 2024 Google laid off roughly a thousand employees from its hardware departments, including people on the Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest teams.\nIn early 2025, Google released a mandatory software update for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense users to “reduce the risk of battery overheating,” which had the unfortunate side effect of reducing battery life from as many as six days to as few as one for some users. However, the fact that we’re getting a significantly redesigned Fitbit app and an AI-powered health coach does show that Google is still investing resources in projects under the Fitbit name. The hardware improvements introduced with the Pixel Watch 4 are also a positive sign that Google remains committed to developing compelling wearable hardware. \nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.
