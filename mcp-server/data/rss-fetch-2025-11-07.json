      "description": "If you've ever hit a transcription tool's time limit halfway through a three-hour lecture recording, you know the frustration. \nYou're left making impossible choices: Which parts of the lecture matter most? Should you split the file and risk losing context? Is it worth paying extra fees just to access your own educational content?\nThe rise of recorded lectures, particularly since the pandemic shift to hybrid learning, has created what UK academics call \"an impossible choice\" between accessibility requirements and practical limitations. \nFor students, researchers, and educators dealing with marathon lectures, dissertation interviews, or day-long conferences, traditional transcription tools with hourly caps aren't just inconvenient—they fundamentally reshape how you engage with academic content.\nThis guide explores why time-limited transcription creates real barriers to learning, examines the technical realities behind arbitrary restrictions, and shows you how unlimited AI transcription is transforming academic workflows for undergraduate students, graduate researchers, and PhD candidates.\nWhen transcription services impose time limits, the impact extends far beyond simple inconvenience. These constraints fundamentally alter student behavior in ways that undermine educational outcomes.\nStudents using time-limited transcription tools face anxiety-driven decisions about what they can afford to transcribe within arbitrary limits, rather than strategic academic choices. Instead of transcribing everything valuable, students develop a scarcity mindset: \"Can I afford to transcribe this optional seminar? What if I need those minutes for exam review?\"\nThis creates a cascade of consequences:\nSelective transcription means missed connections between courses and incomplete research documentation\nUntranscribed lectures remain locked in audio format—unsearchable, unreferenceable, effectively lost unless someone invests hours listening to entire recordings\nRationed learning tools where transcription becomes an emergency backup rather than a foundational study resource\nOpportunity costs that compound over time, leaving gaps in knowledge that could have been avoided\nFor doctoral students building literature reviews, medical residents reviewing grand rounds, or legal students preparing case analyses, these untranscribed resources represent real educational deficits.\nAccurate transcription can take up to three hours for every hour of recorded content, creating an impossible burden for academics. Yet accessibility legislation demands transcripts for recorded educational content, particularly for the estimated 20,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students receiving post-secondary education annually.\nThe math becomes brutal: A graduate student attending three weekly seminars, each lasting 2.5 hours, generates 7.5 hours of content weekly—30 hours monthly. Most \"unlimited\" plans with monthly caps run out by mid-month, forcing students to choose between educational access and budget constraints.\nUniversity lecture transcription serves purposes far beyond simple note-taking. For modern students navigating increasingly complex academic demands, transcripts have become essential infrastructure for learning.\nTranscripts are essential accommodations for students with disabilities, including those with attention difficulties, processing challenges, hearing impairments, or dyslexia. But their value extends to all students:\nInternational students processing lectures in their second or third language benefit from searchable text they can review at their own pace\nWorking students juggling class schedules and employment can engage with lecture content during their available study windows\nVisual learners who struggle with audio-only content can highlight, annotate, and reorganize information in ways that match their cognitive preferences\nResearch students building comprehensive literature reviews need searchable transcripts to locate specific concepts across dozens of recorded presentations\nWhen students have unlimited access to transcription, usage patterns shift dramatically. Rather than rationing transcripts for only the most critical lectures, students begin transcribing:\nOptional guest lectures that provide broader context\nStudy group discussions that clarify complex concepts\nConference presentations that inform their research\nOffice hours conversations where professors explain difficult material one-on-one\nStudents using transcription as a foundational learning tool rather than emergency backup consistently report higher comprehension and better grades, though attributing this solely to transcription oversimplifies the factors involved in academic performance.\nThe transformation isn't about replacing attendance—it's about creating study materials that make review efficient, comprehensive, and tailored to individual learning styles.\nHere's what most transcription services won't tell you: The technical infrastructure exists to handle longer files, and cloud computing with advanced AI models can process extended audio without difficulty. The limitations are primarily business decisions rather than technological constraints.\nAI transcription relies on automatic speech recognition technology, using neural networks that understand context, accents, and background noise. The process involves:\nAudio preprocessing to remove background noise and normalize volume levels\nFeature extraction identifying acoustic patterns, phonemes, and timing information\nPattern recognition matching audio to probable words using machine learning models trained on massive speech datasets\nContextual refinement where the AI considers surrounding words to improve accuracy\nModern AI transcription processes audio remarkably fast—often in real-time or faster than the original duration. A 3-hour lecture that would take a human transcriptionist 9-12 hours to transcribe manually can be processed by AI in minutes.\nIf the technology supports long-form transcription, why do services cap usage?\nThe reasons are purely commercial:\nTiered pricing models that push users toward more expensive plans\nResource allocation favoring higher-paying enterprise customers\nCompetitive positioning where \"unlimited\" becomes a premium feature\nUsage management preventing server load from free-tier users\nThese business decisions create friction points that disproportionately affect students and academic researchers—users who need extensive transcription but operate on limited budgets.\nLet's examine how mainstream AI transcription tools actually perform with extended academic recordings.\nOtter.ai offers 300 minutes monthly on its Basic plan at $16.99 per month, with a 90-minute limit per conversation. While the platform excels at real-time meeting transcription with calendar integration, its structure becomes problematic for academic users.\n\nThe reality for students: A single three-hour graduate seminar requires splitting into three separate files, breaking conversational context and creating management overhead. Monthly limits evaporate by week two for students in heavy lecture schedules.\nStudent discount consideration: With educational pricing, costs drop to approximately $80 annually—but the fundamental limitation remains. You're still managing quotas during finals week when transcription needs peak.\nRev.com provides transcription through its API at $0.02 per minute with no monthly subscription. The accuracy is solid for clear audio, but the pricing model creates budget uncertainty.\n\nCost breakdown: A student transcribing three 3-hour lectures weekly faces roughly $43 monthly—$516 annually—before factoring in additional recordings like study sessions or research interviews. That urgent 6-hour conference panel? You're calculating costs instead of focusing on content.\nDescript bundles transcription with video editing capabilities, charging $24 monthly for 10 hours of transcription. The platform shines when creating polished video content with features like filler word removal and automatic video cuts.\n\nThe limitation: Research teams or students with multiple weekly seminars burn through that 10-hour quota rapidly. For someone transcribing two 4-hour lectures weekly, you've used your allotment and it's only Tuesday.\nNeverCap (https://nevercap.ai/) offers truly unlimited AI transcription at $8.99 per month with no minute caps, processing up to 50 files at once, fundamentally changing the transcription equation for students and researchers.\n\nIndividual files can be up to 10 hours long or 5GB in size, and you can upload as many batches as you want, all month long. This isn't \"unlimited with fair use policies\" or \"unlimited with storage restrictions.\" It's genuinely unlimited long audio file transcription designed for users who need comprehensive coverage.\n10-hour file limit accommodates full-day conferences, dissertation defenses, or combined lecture recordings\n50-file batch processing lets you upload an entire semester's recorded lectures simultaneously\nNo monthly minute pools means no anxiety during finals week or dissertation writing periods\n96% accuracy guarantee for clear audio, with AI trained on millions of hours of diverse content\nSupport for 100+ languages serving international students and multilingual research\nThe undergraduate experience involves juggling multiple courses simultaneously, each with 2-3 hours of weekly lecture time. Graduate students add seminars, research presentations, and committee meetings. PhD candidates accumulate hundreds of hours of interviews, conference presentations, and dissertation defense preparation.\nTraditional transcription tools force these users into artificial constraints: splitting files, managing quotas, making prioritization decisions based on minutes remaining rather than academic value.\nNeverCap eliminates this cognitive overhead entirely.\nConsider the math: If you're transcribing 15 hours of lectures monthly, Otter.ai costs $30 and requires file splitting, Rev.ai costs around $18 with unpredictable charges, Descript costs $24 requiring upgrades for more hours, while NeverCap costs $8.99 with zero usage anxiety.\nMore importantly, you're not spending mental energy on quota management. That 7-hour conference recording? Upload it. Back-to-back seminar sessions? Process them all. Weekly 3-hour graduate courses? Never think twice.\nNeverCap's AI handles accents, technical terms, and multiple speakers exceptionally well, with smart punctuation and speaker diarization for up to 20 speakers. These capabilities directly address common academic scenarios:\nMulti-speaker seminars: Graduate seminars with extensive discussion between professor and 15+ students require robust speaker identification. NeverCap's 20-speaker diarization handles large seminar formats, panel discussions, and dissertation committees.\nTechnical terminology: STEM lectures filled with discipline-specific jargon—whether quantum mechanics, biochemical pathways, or machine learning algorithms—require AI trained on diverse technical content. NeverCap's training on millions of hours means better recognition of specialized vocabulary.\nInternational accents: University classrooms increasingly include professors and students from diverse linguistic backgrounds. AI transcription must handle varied accents without significant accuracy drops.\nSmart punctuation: Automatically generated punctuation transforms walls of text into readable, properly structured content, reducing the editing burden for students creating study materials.\nHere's how unlimited transcription changes actual student workflows:\nBefore lectures:\nRecord lectures using your phone, laptop, or dedicated recorder\nDon't worry about file length or quality—you'll transcribe everything\nAfter lectures:\nUpload recordings to NeverCap immediately (or batch-upload weekly)\nProcess 50 files at once—your entire week's lectures simultaneously\nTranscripts ready within minutes, not hours\nDuring study sessions:\nSearch transcripts for specific concepts across multiple lectures\nCreate summarized notes by copying relevant transcript sections\nReference exact professor explanations when confused about concepts\nShare transcripts with study groups (following institutional policies)\nBefore exams:\nKeyword-search all semester transcripts for exam topics\nCompare how professors explained concepts across different lectures\nCreate comprehensive review guides pulling from multiple sources\nThe transformation isn't just about convenience—it's about creating a searchable knowledge base from your entire academic experience.\nWhile unlimited access removes usage anxiety, audio quality still dramatically impacts transcription accuracy. Here's how to optimize your recordings for the best results.\nSeating position matters significantly—sitting toward the front and center of the classroom dramatically improves audio quality, as proximity to the professor improves recording clarity.\nOptimal recording practices:\nUse your phone's voice memo app or a dedicated audio recorder\nPosition the microphone 6-12 inches from the speaker when possible\nKeep the microphone steady to avoid handling noise\nTest your recording setup before the first critical lecture\nEnvironmental considerations:\nChoose seats away from HVAC vents, hallway doors, and high-traffic areas\nIn large lecture halls, proximity to speakers matters more than microphone quality\nFor seminar-style discussions, center seating captures all participants\nWith NeverCap's 10-hour limit, most academic scenarios don't require file splitting. However, understanding when to split remains useful:\nKeep as single files:\nFull-length lectures (1-4 hours)\nHalf-day or full-day workshops\nConference sessions with Q&A\nDissertation defenses\nCommittee meetings\nConsider splitting:\nMulti-day conferences (split by day or session)\nWeekly lecture series (one file per lecture for easier organization)\nThematic interview series where topics change dramatically\nThe key difference: With unlimited transcription, splitting decisions are based on organizational convenience, not artificial limitations.\nNot all lectures record perfectly. Here's how to maximize accuracy with imperfect audio:\nFor lectures with heavy accents or terminology:\nNeverCap includes smart enhancement features to improve results for challenging audio\nAccept that 96% accuracy means some editing—budget time accordingly\nCreate custom glossaries of repeated technical terms for manual correction\nFor multi-speaker discussions:\nSpeaker identification works best when speakers have distinct voices\nIn dense discussions with overlapping speech, expect lower accuracy\nConsider recording from multiple positions if permitted\nFor low-quality historical recordings:\nOlder cassette tape transfers or compressed audio files present challenges\nAudio restoration tools can improve quality before transcription\nUnderstand that some vintage recordings may require more manual editing\nDeaf students who usually lip-read found that remote learning's recorded content offered better accessibility when properly transcribed, as the acoustic and visual environment was often better online. However, automatic transcription quality remains a concern for accessibility compliance.\nKey considerations:\n96% accuracy is often sufficient for personal study, but accessibility requirements may demand higher standards\nStudents with accommodations may receive professionally edited transcripts from disability services\nSelf-transcribed content can supplement official accommodations\nAlways follow institutional policies regarding shared transcripts and accommodation coordination\nRaw transcripts provide value, but transformed transcripts become powerful learning tools. Here's how to extract maximum educational value from your transcribed lectures.\nStep 1: Initial review\nRead through the transcript shortly after the lecture while memory is fresh\nHighlight unfamiliar terms or concepts requiring further research\nNote sections where your understanding feels incomplete\nStep 2: Structural organization\nIdentify major themes or topics within the lecture\nCreate section headers for different conceptual blocks\nRearrange content thematically if the professor's presentation was non-linear\nStep 3: Synthesis and summarization\nWrite brief summaries of each major section in your own words\nExtract key definitions, formulas, or frameworks\nNote connections to other course material or readings\nStep 4: Question generation\nTransform important statements into potential exam questions\nIdentify areas requiring additional clarification or research\nCreate self-quiz questions for active recall practice\nAlways follow university policies on sharing course materials, as some institutions restrict sharing even among enrolled students. Within appropriate boundaries, transcripts enable powerful collaborative study:\nStudy group preparation:\nShare annotated transcripts before study sessions\nEach member can review different lectures, then teach others\nCompare notes and interpretations across multiple perspectives\nPeer teaching:\nUse transcripts to prepare explanations of difficult concepts\nReference exact professor explanations during peer tutoring\nCreate teaching outlines pulling from multiple lecture transcripts\nResearch collaboration:\nPhD students can share conference presentation transcripts with research groups\nLab meetings become searchable knowledge bases\nMethodology discussions remain accessible to new team members\nTranscripts work best as part of a comprehensive study system:\nWith textbook readings:\nCross-reference transcript concepts with textbook chapters\nNote where professor emphasis differs from textbook treatment\nBuild integrated understanding across multiple sources\nWith lecture slides:\nUse hybrid approach of transcripts for content plus photos of board or slides for visual elements to create comprehensive study material\nLink transcript sections to specific slides for visual reinforcement\nNote when professors diverge from slide content during actual lectures\nWith active recall systems:\nExport important sections to flashcard apps\nCreate spaced repetition schedules for key concepts\nUse transcript searches to verify understanding before exams\nFor students operating on limited budgets, transcription cost directly competes with textbooks, meal plans, and basic living expenses. Understanding the true cost of transcription options matters.\nNearly 1 in 4 undergraduate students and more than 1 in 10 graduate students experience food insecurity, making every dollar compete with basic nutrition. In this context, academic tools must justify their cost against fundamental needs.\nAnnual cost comparison:\nOtter.ai: $80 annually with student discount (but still limited to 300 monthly minutes)\nRev.ai: $516 annually for student transcribing three 3-hour lectures weekly\nDescript: $288 annually (still requires quota management at 10 hours monthly)\nNeverCap: $108 annually with zero usage limits\nThe difference isn't just dollars—it's predictability. NeverCap's $8.99 monthly cost represents a fixed, predictable expense where students know exactly what they're spending without surprise overages or anxiety monitoring remaining minutes during finals week.\nCost matters, but value extends beyond simple pricing:\nTime savings:\nAn amateur transcriber typically takes about four hours to transcribe one hour of audio\nAI transcription completes the same work in minutes\nFor a student with 10 hours of weekly lectures, AI saves 40+ hours monthly\nLearning outcomes:\nStudents with searchable transcripts can review more efficiently\nExam preparation becomes targeted rather than re-listening to hours of audio\nResearch students can analyze patterns across dozens of interviews\nAccessibility:\nNo transcription tool means recorded content remains audio-only\nStudents with different learning styles can't engage effectively\nInternational students struggle with second-language audio comprehension\nStress reduction:\nUnlimited transcription eliminates usage anxiety\nNo mid-semester realization that you're out of minutes\nFocus on learning instead of resource management\nFor students regularly working with long audio files, the question becomes: What's the cost of not having comprehensive transcription?\nBefore transcribing university lectures, understand the legal and ethical landscape surrounding classroom recordings.\nIf university policy or professor preferences are unclear, email your professor asking \"I'd like to record lectures for personal study and review purposes. Is that acceptable?\"\nGeneral guidelines:\nCheck institutional policies: Many universities have official recording policies in their student handbooks\nState recording laws: Some jurisdictions require two-party consent for recordings\nCourse syllabi: Recording policies may be specified in course materials\nProfessor discretion: Individual instructors may prohibit recordings even if institutionally permitted\nAccommodation route: If you have documented disabilities requiring accommodations, work with disability services to potentially require recording as a reasonable accommodation under ADA and Section 504.\nLegal permission to record doesn't eliminate ethical obligations:\nPersonal use boundaries:\nNever share lecture recordings or transcripts with students not enrolled in the course\nDon't post transcripts publicly or on file-sharing platforms\nAvoid distributing content that could undermine professor intellectual property\nIntellectual property respect:\nProfessors create original content and their intellectual property deserves protection by not distributing recordings publicly\nCourse materials may be copyrighted even if not explicitly marked\nAcademic integrity means respecting creator rights\nPrivacy considerations:\nDon't record or share classmate questions or comments without consent\nSeminar discussions may include personal experiences or confidential information\nGroup project recordings require agreement from all participants\nAcademic integrity:\nUse transcripts to enhance learning, not to skip class—transcripts supplement attendance, they don't replace it\nEngagement with professors and peers provides value transcripts can't capture\nPhysical attendance enables real-time questions and discussion\nAs educational technology evolves, transcription is becoming fundamental infrastructure rather than optional enhancement.\nThe pandemic forced rapid adoption of lecture recording, and many institutions discovered that recorded content benefits all students, not just those requiring accommodations. The post-pandemic explosion in recorded content has created what UK academics call \"an impossible choice\" between accessibility requirements and already-breaking workloads.\nUniversities increasingly provide lecture capture systems as standard\nAccessibility requirements demand transcripts for all recorded content\nStudents expect recorded lectures as baseline, not premium features\nHybrid learning models make recordings necessary for flexible attendance\nThe question isn't whether long-form transcription is possible with time-limited tools—workarounds exist. The question is whether you want to spend your time managing transcription logistics or focusing on content that actually matters.\nAs recorded academic content proliferates, unlimited transcription shifts from luxury to necessity. Consider:\nResearch students conducting 30+ dissertation interviews shouldn't manage quotas\nGraduate seminars running 3+ hours shouldn't require file splitting\nConference attendees capturing full-day sessions shouldn't calculate costs\nInternational students processing lectures in second languages shouldn't ration transcription\nThe future belongs to services recognizing that users should focus on content, not file management.\nTranscripts are increasingly becoming inputs for AI-powered study assistants. With comprehensive transcripts from all lectures, students can:\nAsk AI to identify patterns across multiple lectures\nGenerate practice exams based on professor emphasis\nCreate personalized study guides matching individual learning styles\nCompare concepts across courses for interdisciplinary understanding\nThis transformation requires unlimited access to source material. Transcribing everything becomes the foundation enabling next-generation educational AI.\nWhen choosing a transcription service for marathon lectures, ask yourself: Am I selecting a tool that serves my workflow, or am I adapting my workflow to serve the tool's limitations?\nFor students, graduate researchers, and PhD candidates regularly working with long audio files, the answer becomes clear once you experience transcription without artificial constraints.\nNeverCap's approach—truly unlimited AI transcription at $8.99 monthly, processing files up to 10 hours, handling 50 simultaneous uploads, supporting 100+ languages with 96% accuracy—isn't just competitive pricing. It's a fundamentally different philosophy: your academic workflow shouldn't be shaped by arbitrary business limitations.\nUniversity lecture transcription, research interview processing, conference recording analysis—these aren't edge cases requiring premium pricing. They're core educational activities deserving accessible, unlimited tools.\nThe choice is yours: continue managing quotas, splitting files, and making anxiety-driven decisions about what deserves transcription, or focus entirely on learning, researching, and engaging with content that matters.\nFor anyone serious about academic success in an era of extensive recorded content, unlimited long audio transcription isn't a luxury—it's foundational infrastructure.\nQ: Can AI transcription really handle 10-hour files without quality degradation?\nQ: How does 96% accuracy compare to human transcription?\nQ: What file formats does NeverCap support?\nQ: Can I transcribe lectures in languages other than English?\nQ: How long does it take to transcribe a 3-hour lecture?\nQ: Is there a free trial to test NeverCap before subscribing?\nQ: Can I share transcripts with my study group?\nQ: What if my recording quality is poor?\nQ: How does speaker identification work with multiple students talking?\nQ: Can I use NeverCap for dissertation interview transcription?\nQ: What's the difference between NeverCap and free tools like Google's voice typing?\nQ: Do I need to split 4-hour lecture recordings?\nQ: Is my data secure when uploading to NeverCap?\nQ: Can I edit transcripts within NeverCap or do I need to export first?\nQ: How does unlimited transcription work with batch uploads?\nQ: What happens if I exceed the 10-hour single file limit?\nQ: Can I cancel my subscription if I only need transcription during the semester?\nYes. Monthly subscriptions offer flexibility for students who only need transcription during active semesters. Subscribe for academic terms and cancel during breaks. This keeps costs aligned with actual usage periods while maintaining unlimited access when needed.",

      "description": "Earlier this year, we introduced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, a fully managed service that serves as a centralized MCP tool server, providing a unified interface where agents can discover, access, and invoke tools. Today, we're extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational complexity of maintaining separate gateways, while providing the same centralized tool and authentication management that existed for REST APIs and AWS Lambda functions.",

AI control offers one approach to mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols, including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03070v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications. Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or false answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time, classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions, challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer 1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also limited.",

Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03106v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches, inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss. We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach. Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist artificial intelligence models in healthcare.",

In such setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language, formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements, and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the autoformalization models and theorem provers.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03137v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA).

This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03179v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03235v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 > 0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.",

While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.",

GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement ({\\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002).

In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02848v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring brain activity, but low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to various artifacts often compromise its utility. Conventional artifact removal methods require manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during filtering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce EEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction via cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow (v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume conduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and dynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating reference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive windows and generalizes effectively across subjects. This design improves spatial-temporal-spectral resolution (mean PSD correlation >= 0.95; mean spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85), reduces total weights by ~45% to mitigate overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for robust, real-time EEG preprocessing in neurophysiological and BCI applications.",

To bridge this gap, we propose LiteHeart, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation framework. LiteHeart introduces a region-aware distillation module to mimic how cardiologists focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions and a cross-layer mutual information module to align the decision processes of LCCI and HCCI systems. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, LiteHeart further improves model robustness under limited supervision. Evaluated on five datasets covering over 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart substantially reduces the performance gap between LCCI and HCCI, outperforming existing methods by 4.27% to 7.10% in macro F1 score. These results demonstrate that LiteHeart significantly enhances the diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac intelligence systems, paving the way for scalable, affordable, and accurate daily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies.",

While existing paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative refinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or reranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains underexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance exploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon Self-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that are fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently achieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same maximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for improvement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft capabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and fragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary notably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors. Overall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic exploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback and discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances.",

AdapterFusion is a PEFT architecture that aims to enhance task performance by leveraging information from multiple programming languages, but primarily focuses on the target programming language.\n  In our previous work, we proposed AdvFusion, a novel PEFT-based approach that effectively learns from other programming languages before adapting to the target task. Though previous experiments showed that AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion and LoRA, it was applied on pre-trained Code-LMs and was limited to only two tasks, code summarization and method name prediction. In this study, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language Models (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code translation, and commit message generation. We observed that different Code-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation, AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA, Compacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion performed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that the other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation, AdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap marginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code generation, other PEFT methods showed better performance.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02872v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02877v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Forecasting chaotic time series requires models that can capture the intrinsic geometry of the underlying attractor while remaining computationally efficient. We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.",

However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.",

Indeed, while support for the design, implementation, and deployment of those agents exist, the specification of Quality of Service (QoS) and definition of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aspects for those agents, important to ensure the quality of the resulting systems, remains an open challenge. Part of this is due to the difficulty to clearly define quality in the context of AI components, resulting in a lack of consensus on how to best approach Quality Assurance (QA) for these types of systems.

That approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on 4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks.

Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.",

However, these properties are not fully captured by data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray dataset.",

It also sharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom, demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing frame rate or phase information.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02944v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret. We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs, our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with statistical validity.",

This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02979v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan- ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from \"feeling\" to \"thinking and acting\" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.",

Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational supervision for cross-modal alignment.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03022v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation. Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\\sim$ 2.31$^\\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\\sim$ 3.26$^\\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.",

Evaluating prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03095v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled, causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data, creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony; locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal, anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03100v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.",

We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 {\\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%).

Further, we relax the conditional independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without relying on additional modules.

Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects, we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and covering 15 defect types.

While recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design, most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95% validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57% in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models have not.

The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data.\n  We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling.\n  Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.",

In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.

Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03152v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03153v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03170v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.",

Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.",

In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.",

A common solution to this challenge is model compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks.

Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participants's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter.

To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

The literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression -- we refer to this as \\emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly extending the scope.

With the rapid transition to and adoption of these \"dual-state\" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active \"thinking mode\" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03330v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the challenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information. However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text, neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning, and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style summarization module converts raw papers into structured and discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels. The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

To systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling), which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis. RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly support the training and generalization of GenAI models.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03367v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

In this paper, we present LQPR, a highly efficient automatic approach for performance requirements quantification.LQPR relies on a new theoretical framework that converts quantification as a classification problem. Despite the prevalent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a different perspective to address the classification: we observed that performance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often short/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced matching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art learning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is ranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost. Our work proves that, at least for performance requirement quantification, specialized methods can be more suitable than the general LLM-driven approaches.",

In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents,\" yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.",

This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time.

The DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters. Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned, thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis.

Unlike traditional language models that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\\lambda} across the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower attention entropy, with {\\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18 bits at {\\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets. Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\\lambda} = 0.6 achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.",

In recent years, advances in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open directions for future research.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03576v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.",

We address this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10% computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems, CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy. Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior an intrinsic property of the learning process.",

Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.",

The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet, the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before, during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2) Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture of LLMs.",

We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.",

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection.

We argue that parametric recalibration functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques.

While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence.

Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment.

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.",

      "description": "arXiv:2504.20462v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Implementing large language models (LLMs)-driven root cause analysis (RCA) in cloud-native systems has become a key topic of modern software operations and maintenance. However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.",

We propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel codes through a multi-stage, iterative approach integrating runtime power profiling, energy-aware prompting, self-correcting feedback loops, and an LLM-as-a-Judge agent for automated screening of code solutions. We introduce energy-reduction@k, a novel metric that quantifies expected energy reduction when generating k code candidates and selecting the most energy-efficient, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-attempt generation strategies. Evaluating 20 HeCBench applications and two miniApps on NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, a single run (k=1) with LASSI-EE delivers refactored parallel codes with an average 29% expected energy reduction at an 81% pass rate, representing a 2.8x improvement over vanilla LLM prompting. Multiple runs (k=3) achieve an average 48% expected energy reduction at a 97% pass rate. These results are consistent across devices, demonstrating LASSI-EE's effectiveness across diverse hardware architectures.",

To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks.

To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency.

Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.",

In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases.\n  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems.

This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly understood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this challenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate text sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high log-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the Truncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by selectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively filtering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively but also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more synthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an open-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results demonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay collapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model robustness under synthetic-data exposure.",

However, LLMs sometimes struggle with reasoning tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for reasoning is impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables. However, they are not designed for multi-step reasoning tasks that require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes.

Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?\n  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.\n  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons.

Correlation analysis ($r \\approx 0.40\\text{--}0.65$) shows that the models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make, highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance, physics, health, and statistics.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02824v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run. Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics. Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four make novel contributions to the scientific literature.",

Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

We have deployed different traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, as well as deep neural network models such as LSTM, CNN, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU to classify these tweets into four emotion categories (Fear, Anger, Joy, and Sadness). Furthermore, we have constructed a BiLSTM and BiGRU ensemble model. The evaluation result shows that the deep neural network models(BiGRU, to be specific) produce the most promising results compared to traditional machine learning models, with an 87.53 % accuracy rate.

We therefore propose to implement numerical discretisations as convolutional layers of a neural network, where the weights or filters are determined analytically rather than by training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these systems can be solved entirely by functions in AI libraries, either by using Jacobi iteration or multigrid methods, the latter realised through a U-Net architecture. Some advantages of the Neural Physics approach are that (1) the methods are platform agnostic; (2) the resulting solvers are fully differentiable, ideal for optimisation tasks; and (3) writing CFD solvers as (untrained) neural networks means that they can be seamlessly integrated with trained neural networks to form hybrid models. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a number of test cases of increasing complexity from advection-diffusion problems, the non-linear Burgers equation to the Navier-Stokes equations. We validate the approach by comparing our results with solutions obtained from traditionally written code and common benchmarks from the literature. We show that the proposed methodology can solve all these problems using repurposed AI libraries in an efficient way, without training, and presents a new avenue to explore in the development of methods to solve PDEs with implicit methods.",

Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models.

      "description": "arXiv:2411.16638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the point that traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as ROUGE, have saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce inaccuracies into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by the corresponding source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle factual inconsistencies automatically has proved challenging. This in turn has motivated development of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of generated summaries against sources. But are these approaches measuring what they purport to? Or are they mostly exploiting artifacts? In this work, we stress test a range of automatic factuality metrics, including specialized models and LLM-based prompting methods, to probe what they actually capture. Using a shallow classifier to separate ``easy'' examples for factual evaluation where surface features suffice from ``hard'' cases requiring deeper reasoning, we find that all metrics show substantial performance drops on the latter. Furthermore, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, fact-preserving edits than to factual corrections. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that most automatic factuality metrics can be gamed, i.e., their scores can be artificially inflated by appending innocuous, content-free sentences to summaries. Among the metrics tested, the prompt based ChatGPT-DA approach is the most robust and reliable. However, this comes with a notable caveat: Prompting LLMs to assess factuality may overly rely on their parametric knowledge rather than the provided reference when making judgments. Taken together, our findings call into question the reliability of current factuality metrics and prompt a broader reflection on what these metrics are truly measuring.",

      "description": "arXiv:2412.16378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: To mitigate reward hacking from response verbosity, modern preference optimization methods are increasingly adopting length normalization (e.g., SimPO, ORPO, LN-DPO). While effective against this bias, we demonstrate that length normalization itself introduces a failure mode: the URSLA shortcut. Here models learn to satisfy the alignment objective by prematurely truncating low-quality responses rather than learning from their semantic content. To address this, we introduce REFA, a new alignment framework that proposes probabilistic control on a structural token that controls termination. Our core innovation is a new class of regularizers that operate directly on the probability of the End-of-Sequence (EOS) token, a previously unexploited control lever. This token-level intervention provides a principled solution to the URSLA shortcut, ensuring genuine quality improvements. Furthermore, it unlocks a versatile mechanism for managing the alignment-efficiency tradeoff, enabling practitioners to fine-tune models that adhere to specific token budgets. Empirically, REFA achieves a 60.29% win rate and a 52.17% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2 with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, demonstrating the power of our token-level control paradigm.",

LSR iteratively refines the classification label space by systematically ranking and reducing candidate classes, enabling the model to concentrate on the most relevant options. By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning capabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space representation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to 14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet compared to standard zero-shot classification baselines.

To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels.

The objective is parameterized by a hybrid scoring metric that combines realized FPL points with predictions from a linear regression model trained on match-performance features identified using exploratory data analysis techniques. The study benchmarks alternative objectives and cost estimators, including simple and recency-weighted averages, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Monte Carlo simulation.

We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved using sequential convex programming (SCP). Onboard, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%.

      "description": "arXiv:2505.12398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second, current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model, guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains. Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput over existing methods.",

We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization.

Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router.

In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify \"heavy-tailedness.\" Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance.

      "description": "arXiv:2506.15679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Despite the significant potential of Foundation Models (FMs) in medical imaging, their application to prognosis prediction remains challenging due to data scarcity, class imbalance, and task complexity, which limit their clinical adoption. This study introduces the first structured benchmark to assess the robustness and efficiency of transfer learning strategies for FMs compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting COVID-19 patient outcomes from chest X-rays. The goal is to systematically compare finetuning strategies, both classical and parameter efficient, under realistic clinical constraints related to data scarcity and class imbalance, offering empirical guidance for AI deployment in clinical workflows. Four publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets were used, covering mortality, severity, and ICU admission, with varying sample sizes and class imbalances. CNNs pretrained on ImageNet and FMs pretrained on general or biomedical datasets were adapted using full finetuning, linear probing, and parameter-efficient methods. Models were evaluated under full data and few shot regimes using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Precision Recall AUC (PR-AUC), with cross validation and class weighted losses. CNNs with full fine-tuning performed robustly on small, imbalanced datasets, while FMs with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), particularly LoRA and BitFit, achieved competitive results on larger datasets. Severe class imbalance degraded PEFT performance, whereas balanced data mitigated this effect. In few-shot settings, FMs showed limited generalization, with linear probing yielding the most stable results. No single fine-tuning strategy proved universally optimal: CNNs remain dependable for low-resource scenarios, whereas FMs benefit from parameter-efficient methods when data are sufficient.",

We ask whether these gains come from major changes in the transformer layers or from smaller adjustments that keep the original structure. Using layer-wise ablation on base and trained variants, we find that math reasoning depends on a few critical layers, which stay important across all post- training methods. Removing these layers reduces math accuracy by as much as 80%, whereas factual recall tasks only show relatively smaller drops. This suggests that specialized layers for mathematical tasks form during pre-training and remain stable afterward. As measured by Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we find that near these critical layers, tokens drift from their original syntactic clusters toward representations aligned with tokens less syntactically related but potentially more useful for downstream task.",

However, model performance may suffer due to data and system heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios. Previous studies have proposed model optimization, fine-tuning, and personalization to achieve improved model performance. Despite these efforts, models resulting from FL scenarios often exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which increases the communication and computational costs of clients for model optimization and raises energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a reference model-based fine-tuning method for federated learning that overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. Our method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning and includes an proximal term. It employs a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters and reviews previous global features in the model optimization step to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. As a result, our method achieves higher model performance and lower communication and computational costs for clients than existing methods.",

Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.",

Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.",

This paper formalizes a deployment oriented setting for real world fatigue detection, where high quality sensors are often unavailable in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging knowledge from heterogeneous source domains, including high fidelity sensors that are difficult to deploy in the field but commonly used in controlled environments, to assist fatigue detection in the real world target domain. Building on this idea, we design a heterogeneous and multiple source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while exploiting diverse configurations in the source domains through alignment across domains and modality imputation. Our experiments, conducted using a field deployed sensor setup and two publicly available human fatigue datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach across subjects and domains.

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.",

One caveat of this methodology is the requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently requires costly manual intervention.

The automatic segmentation tool relies on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of 1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue, from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual labels, including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4mm, and 95\\% Hausdorff distance under 1.60mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

      "description": "arXiv:2508.10409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research use.",

While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport.

Automated tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content, specifically leveraging in-context definition. We also study how LLMs understand and explain their decisions given a moderation policy as a guideline. First, we explore various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT, and find that injecting domain-specific thoughts increases performance and utility. Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, improving performance and utility by reducing refusals across all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model size, or reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

      "description": "arXiv:2509.20409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the grounding process is logically incomplete; specifically, the 'act' of connecting internal symbols to novel, emergent external meanings cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external \"judgment\" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\\\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.",

This canonical form is then employed to derive a standardized representation for $H_{\\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter subgroup $H_{\\gamma}$.

The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques, i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of 95.19%, a balanced accuracy of 88.76%, a precision of 95.26%, a recall of 78.42%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.8886. SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model. Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.04263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but performs exhaustive conditional independence tests across many subsets, often leading to spurious independences, missing or extra edges, and unreliable orientations. We present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that extend this framework. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI, variants of GFCI (Greedy Fast Causal Inference) that substitute BOSS (Best Order Score Search) or GRaSP (Greedy Relaxations of Sparsest Permutation) for FGES (Fast Greedy Equivalence Search), preserving correctness while trading off scalability and conservativeness. Second, we develop FCI Targeted-Testing (FCIT), a novel hybrid method that replaces exhaustive testing with targeted, score-informed tests guided by BOSS. FCIT guarantees well-formed PAGs and achieves higher precision and efficiency across sample sizes. Finally, we propose a lightweight heuristic, LV-Dumb (Latent Variable \"Dumb\"), which returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Though not strictly sound for latent confounding, LV-Dumb often matches FCIT's accuracy while running substantially faster. Simulations and real-data analyses show that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI provide robust baselines, FCIT yields the best balance of precision and reliability, and LV-Dumb offers a fast, near-equivalent alternative. Together, these methods demonstrate that targeted and score-guided strategies can dramatically improve the efficiency and correctness of latent-variable causal discovery.",

This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore.

To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples).

      "description": "arXiv:2510.19444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\\varepsilon \\dashv R_\\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.21861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning, yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families (arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter. Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.",

In contrast, biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al. (2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks (CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most effective.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.22336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace. Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology. Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper, we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that RoboCraft achieves an average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.",

Meanwhile, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.25531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options, leading patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge. To analyze the impact of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This, however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression. We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for addressing small data challenges.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.26125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.",

It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless \"interestingness\"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered \"the last grand challenge\" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a \"good\" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).",

In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a regularization term into the DPO loss to enhance training stability and generation fidelity.

However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench.Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \\$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \\$ 5 API cost per kernel.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts. However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time, general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/scalable-compositional-generalization.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains. However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02900v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\\\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\\sqrt{\\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\\\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02901v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02904v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.",

A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\\'eel state from R\\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and R\\'enyi relative entropies.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02914v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.",

These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.02980v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose a quantum-inspired combinatorial solver that performs imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a matrix product state (MPS), incorporating non-local couplings through structured SWAP networks and spectral qubit mapping of logical qubits. The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over 20$\\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering. Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.",

We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations.

This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of \"which-way\" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration.

In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\\sim1$~nm precision.

The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point.

While mathematical optimization approaches, formulated as job shop scheduling problems, have been applied to automate this process, solving large-scale production planning problems remains computationally demanding. Moreover, many practical scenarios involve conflicting objectives, making traditional scalarization techniques ineffective in finding diverse and useful Pareto-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we developed a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that decomposes the problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and task scheduling. Resource allocation is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved using annealing-based methods that efficiently explore complex solutions. Task scheduling is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using conventional solvers to satisfy detailed scheduling constraints. We validated the proposed method using benchmark instances based on foundry production scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves superior solution quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional monolithic methods.

In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.",

It also raises concerns over the scalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow to adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction methods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several generated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods, and data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led us to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results in skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the actual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several factors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this problem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum information embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical components associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine learning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range of 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03327v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) offers a promising framework for solving NP-hard optimization problems, but its effectiveness is constrained by the topology of the underlying quantum hardware. Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA involves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$ as a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$ that defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing unit (QPU).\n  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware compilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$ -- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by means of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical connections among qubits in $G_Q$.\n  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient compilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a methodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$ can negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum optimization more sensible to noise.\n  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used in current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled variation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio `number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to map $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.\n  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum, architectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require shorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the largest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases. These characteristics indicate their potential as alternative designs for QA-based QPUs.",

This work investigates dynamical discontinuities that arise when the post-selected polar angle is used as a control parameter. The system evolves under repeated applications of a weak measurement protocol with post-selection, in which the meter state is retained after each iteration while the system is renewed. The emergence of these discontinuities is shown to be determined by the structure of the weak value: when the weak value has a nonzero imaginary component, a discontinuity appears in the expectation value of meter observables precisely at the point where the imaginary part of the weak value vanishes as a function of the post-selection polar angle. In contrast, no discontinuities occur when the weak value remains real for all post-selection angles. The phenomenon originates from the eigenstructure of the protocol's Kraus operator, with the stability of fixed points changing at the critical point where the discontinuity arises. Remarkably, the associated critical exponent is 1, independent of system parameters. These results open new perspectives for engineering non-analytic behavior in measurement-based quantum control and for probing criticality in post-selected quantum dynamics using weak measurements with weak values.",

We work with minimal, physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility, and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species, fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences. Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03556v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03561v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.",

Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms.

A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes.

We find that the non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\\delta$. Next, we analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \\ne 0$), strong interactions leads to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong) interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information, $F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \\propto t^{\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha \\sim 3$.

With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\\pm \\Omega_\\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\\mu{\\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise.

Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.",

Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.",

The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03253v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.",

Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.",

In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.",

In our model, an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system, with copies of a $k$-dimensional probe ($k\\leq d$), which are then used to unitarily reconstruct an estimate state in $d$-dimensional memories.

To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\\propto 1/{(N\\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes.

      "description": "arXiv:2501.00579v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.",

A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling.

We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\\chi_{\\delta}({|{H}\\rangle^{ \\otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\\rangle}^{\\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime.\n  Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound.\n  Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products.\n  Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.",

A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.",

As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \\geq 2$ spatial dimensions.

The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.",

In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.",

However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \\textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost.

      "description": "arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.",

Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.",

Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that defines the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. This extension not only broadens the scope of quantum resource theories and provides more comprehensive operational interpretations, but also delivers crucial insights for classifying and interpreting mixed resource states -- specifically those with inactive resource properties in certain tasks -- that have remained uncharacterized in conventional quantum resource theories. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the proposed geometric measure satisfies the framework's requirements for both quantum coherence and entanglement, while also demonstrating its ability to characterize the operational disadvantage of arbitrary states compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination tasks under specific conditions.",

By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.",

We also introduce a procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. In addition, we present logical state teleportation circuits that transfer encoded states between the two codes, allowing all logical operations to be performed transversally. Our methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost. Finally, using the 15-qubit code as an example, we demonstrate that our protocols significantly reduce the gate overhead compared with other existing methods.

However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses.

This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction.

We show numerical evidence that this ensemble shares some key statistical properties with the Rosenzweig-Porter ensemble for both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates.",

      "description": "arXiv:2404.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.",

Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\\mathbf{E}$ with $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$ with $\\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.",

A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.",

While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.",

Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.",

The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.",

Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "title": "Robotic Fish Zips Through Water With Flexible Electromagnetic Fin",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robot-electromagnetic-fin",
      "description": "This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore.\nFish are able to dart quickly through the water and turn on a dime with a flick of their tail. Researchers have been trying to achieve similar results with aquatic robots. In fact, one group in China has made progress using a flexible electromagnetic fin that propels an underwater robot at 405 millimeters—or 1.66 body lengths—per second. The team’s robotic swimmer can also make turns over just a 0.86 body-length radius.\nFanghao Zhou, an assistant professor at the State Key Laboratory of Ocean Sensing at Zhejiang University in Zhejiang, China, helped guide the research. Zhou notes that fish are agile, efficient, and adaptive—and robotically mimicking these qualities is a challenge.\n“Traditional robotic fins powered by motors can generate strong thrust, but they’re often bulky and rigid,” he says. “Soft actuators, on the other hand, are flexible but usually too weak to be practical. Our goal was to combine the best of both fields—a compact actuator that’s powerful yet flexible, like real muscle.”\nMaking a New Kind of Fin\nSo the research team designed a flexible electromagnetic fin with an elastic joint that swishes back and forth with little friction. It’s built with two small coils and spherical magnets. When alternating current flows through the coils, it creates an oscillating magnetic field that makes the fin flap back and forth, much like a fish’s tail. When the magnetic field isn’t oscillating, the fin returns to a neutral position at rest. \nIn their study, the researchers tested their bionic fin in a pool. Zhe Wang, a Ph.D. student in Zhou’s lab, emphasizes that the team not only successfully piloted the bionic fin in water, but they also built a mathematical model connecting electrical input to hydrodynamic thrust output. “That means we can predict how the fin will behave underwater just from the input current, which is rare in soft robotics,” he says. \n  A new robotic fish design reveals different swimming behaviors at different fin oscillation speeds.  Zhe Wang et al. \nIn their experiments, the researchers used a high-speed camera and precision force sensor to measure the trajectory of the fin and the thrust it generated—achieving a peak thrust of 0.493 newtons, despite the fin weighing just 17 grams. \nZhou notes the robotic system is small, lightweight, and powerful, and it will also be easy to scale into multi-fin systems. However, he adds that the current design consumes a lot of energy. “The electromagnetic coils draw a lot of current, so the swimming duration is relatively short,” he explains. “We are exploring ways to reduce energy loss, for example [by] optimizing coil geometry, using energy recovery circuits, and applying smart control strategies that don’t require continuous excitation.”\nThe researchers anticipate this robotic system could have a range of applications, including perhaps in underwater exploration, ecological monitoring, and inspection—such as safely interacting with coral reefs and marine life.\n“Our next step is to study multi-fin coordinated motion, enabling the robot to perform more flexible and lifelike swimming behaviors,” Wang says. “We are also exploring ways to improve energy efficiency, extend operation time, and further miniaturize the system for small autonomous underwater platforms.”\nThe researchers’ bionic fin is described in a study published 4 September in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "description": "Deadly intestinal cancers are on the rise, and the best chance to beat them is with an early diagnosis. But current techniques used to inspect the digestive tract are highly invasive, scaring many patients away. Some researchers hope that soft, magnetically controlled robots the size of a vitamin capsule could replace these diagnostic methods in a few short years.\nA team led by Qingsong Xu, a professor of electromechanical engineering at the University of Macau in China, recently unveiled a micro-robot prototype inspired by the locomotion of an African spider that cartwheels across the desert dunes of Namibia instead of crawling. \nThe robot, made of a rubber-like magnetic material, has been tested in animal stomachs, colons, and small intestines. The researchers said it successfully navigated the “complex environment” of the digestive tract, full of mucus, sharp turns, and obstacles as tall as 8 centimeters high. \nToday’s procedures use endoscopes, flexible tubes fitted with a camera that doctors insert into the patient’s digestive tracts through the mouth or rectum. The procedure requires sedation due to the extreme discomfort it causes to the patient, and improper manipulation with the endoscope can cause serious injuries, including bowel perforation. Some patients might delay the investigation out of fear, which could have catastrophic consequences as cancer might spread. Other diseases, such as stomach ulcers and Crohn’s disease are also diagnosed with endoscopy.\n“Traditional endoscopes cause a lot of discomfort and cannot easily access complex deeper regions inside the body,” Xu told IEEE Spectrum. “The purpose of the soft magnetic robot is to provide a minimally invasive, controllable, and highly flexible alternative.”\nHow the Robot Moves\nSoft magnetic robots, like that developed by Xu, offer a more palatable alternative to endoscopy. The robot, the size of a large vitamin capsule, could be swallowed with relative ease and pass through the stomach and the entire length of the small and large intestines, propelled by an externally applied magnetic field. The robotic mini-spider could perform detailed inspections of the complicated terrain without bothering the patient too much. At the end of its journey, it passes out of the body just like processed food.\nOther teams have experimented with various types of robot locomotion, including crawling, jumping, and swimming, the researchers said in a paper describing the new robot, published in the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing last month. Those earlier designs, however, had limitations when traversing such complex environments as the digestive tract. \n  These series of images show how the robot moves through the stomach. In the rightmost column, the researchers also demonstrate targeted drug delivery. Ruomeng Xu, Xianli Wang, et al.\n“We went for a design inspired by the golden wheel spider, because it provided superior obstacle crossing ability and energy efficiency compared to other locomotion models,” Xu said. “By mimicking this type of locomotion in the patient, the robot can navigate in the mucus, in the folded and even vertically inclined surfaces with remarkable stability.”\nThe golden wheel spider is a small arachnid, about 2 centimeters wide, that escapes danger by curling its legs around its body and rolling down the sloping desert dunes. The robot developed by the Macau team uses the same strategy, but instead of being propelled by gravity, it rolls through the digestive tract thanks to an external magnetic force that interacts with tiny magnets in the robot’s legs. To control the robot with precision, the researchers created a dexterous robotic arm fitted with a powerful rotating magnet that sits next to the patient during the procedure.\nThe Future of Gut Diagnostics\nThe researchers plan to perform further experiments with live animals and, if all goes well, move to clinical trials with humans. Xu hopes the soft spider robots could help doctors examine patients’ insides in as little as five years. \n“The medical community increasingly recognizes the potential of soft magnetic robots to revolutionize endoscopic procedures by minimizing patient discomfort and increasing precision,” said Xu. “There is a lot of interest in the medical world.”\nIn the not-so-distant future, advances in micro-robotics may enable targeted drug delivery in the treatment of ulcers or tumors. The tiny robots could also be used in a range of minimally invasive interventions and examinations. The field has been growing rapidly in the past few years, although no such robots have yet made it into clinical practice, and magnetically controlled robots are a promising field of development many researchers are exploring.\nFor example, a team from North Carolina State University recently presented another such robot, also using a flexible magnetic material. Instead of cartwheeling, the North Carolina robot crawls through the digestive tract like a caterpillar; the external magnetic forces induce contractions in its 3D-printed origami-style structure. A paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials described experiments with the robot delivering mock treatment to a mock stomach ulcer. \nXiaomeng Fang, assistant professor in material engineering at North Carolina State University and lead author of the paper, told IEEE Spectrum the work has garnered a lot of interest. “These robots are soft and they can be controlled remotely,” she said. “They can also change their shape, which makes them very interesting for treatment of internal diseases.”",

      "description": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nHappy Halloween from UCL!\n\n[ University College London ]\n\nHappy Halloween from KIMLAB!\n\n[ Kinetic Intelligent Machine Lab ]\n\nHappy Halloween from the DRAGON Lab!\n\n[ DRAGON Lab, University of Tokyo ]\nThanks, Moju!\n\nHappy Halloween from Agility Robotics!\n\n[ Agility Robotics ]\n\nHappy Halloween from HEBI Robotics!\n\n[ HEBI Robotics ]\n\nYou can now pay 1X $500/mo to collect data in your home.\n\nAnd it’s about what you’d expect:\n  \n[ 1X ] via [ WSJ ]\n\nAt our test warehouse, we recreate our customers’ inbound operations, from the dock configuration and conveyors, to the freight and beyond. Step inside our Stretch testing facility to learn about the the latest developments in warehouse automation and explore how we ensure robust, reliable performance in the real world.\n\n[ Boston Dynamics ]\n\nWell this is just mean. Important, but mean.\n\n[ Istituto Italiano de Tecnologia ]\n\nSpikeATac is a a multimodal tactile finger combining a taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its `spiky’ response, SpikeATac’s multitaxel PVDF film provides fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact, providing the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping fragile, deformable objects.\n\n[ ROAM Lab, Columbia University ]\n\nEffectively integrating diverse sensory representations is crucial for robust robotic manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental integration of new representations.\n\n[ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nGeneral-purpose robots should possess human-like dexterity and agility to perform tasks with the same versatility as us. A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF.\n\n[ ORCA ]\n\nUniversity of Chicago computer scientist Sarah Sebo is programming robots to give empathetic responses and perform nonverbal social cues like nodding to better build trust and rapport with humans. The goal is to develop robots that can improve performance in human-robot teams, such as enhancing learning outcomes for children.\n\n[ University of Chicago ]\n\nDJI has a robot vacuum now, which is fine. As far as I can make out, we’ve reached the point where just about every robot vacuum is (for better or worse) just that: fine.\n\n[ DJI ]\n\nThis ICRA 2025 keynote is from Angela Schoellig at Technical University of Munich, on “Powering Robotics with AI.”\n\n[ ICRA 2025 ]\n\nThis Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute (CMU RI) Seminar is from Nancy Pollard, on “Bringing Dexterity to Robot Hands in the Real World.”\n\nDexterous manipulation is a grand challenge of robotics, and fine manipulation skills are required for many robotics applications that we envision. In this overview talk, I will discuss my view of some major factors that contribute to dexterity and discuss how we can incorporate them into our robots and systems.\n[ CMU RI ]",

      "title": "The best AirPods to buy",
      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/645217/best-apple-airpods-pro",
      "description": "Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes only work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.\nThere are currently four AirPods models to choose from, each with its own distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of over-ear headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple offers three options: the AirPods Pro 3, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4.\nHow we test AirPods\nWe spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we test the active noise cancellation across a wide range of environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.\nThe best AirPods overall\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam and silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro are better than their predecessor in numerous ways, starting with the fit. Apple’s latest flagship earbuds feature a more angular design and a wider range of ear tip sizes — including an XXS option. Their “foam-infused” tips combine foam and silicone, so they expand slightly for better comfort and a tighter seal. If you’ve ever cursed at AirPods for falling out of your ears, the Pro 3’s improved fit alone might sell you.\nThey also deliver upgrades to noise cancellation, which allow them to rival even the AirPods Max. They’re noticeably better at dampening high-frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro, and they can eliminate the low hum of an airplane engine. Sound quality has also been improved in ways that were surprisingly easy to pick out: bass is punchier, vocals are clearer, and you’ll notice new layers in your favorite tracks. Meanwhile, battery life will last you a full work day with ANC enabled before the buds need to go back into the charging case for a refill.\nIn addition to giving users the flexibility to use these earbuds as clinical-grade hearing aids — a feature introduced last year — Apple has added a heart rate sensor to this model, allowing you to track workouts right from your ears. Add in IP57 water and dust resistance, stronger Find My capabilities, and a live translation feature, and it’s clear the AirPods Pro are Apple’s best wireless earbuds by a wide margin.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best AirPods for those who find ear tips uncomfortable\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: No / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nNot everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation in the AirPods Pro 3, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never totally cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need it.\nApple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same good sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. The more expensive pair has features that you might want, including active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case (it supports Find My and wireless charging). You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC, since these don’t use a sealed ear tip.\nIf you’re truly interested in noise-canceling earbuds, consider upgrading to the AirPods Pro 3. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience overall. I’d only steer you to the noise-canceling AirPods 4 if you’re really opposed to ear tips.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\n\n\nScore: 8.5\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHigh-luxury design\nTerrific, balanced sound quality\nVery effective noise cancellation\nDependable and foolproof controls\nSpatial audio for immersive entertainment\n\nHeavier than many competitors\nNo 3.5mm jack\nWired listening requires $35 cable\nCase is an abomination\nLacks latest AirPods Pro features\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $495.81 at Amazon\n $549.99 $499.99 at Best Buy\n $549 $529 at B&H Photo\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 20 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: No / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nWe’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at a high cost. Not just that, these headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and probably won’t leave you with sweaty ears. \nThe AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones.\nYou lose some features found in the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC — including conversation awareness and adaptive audio — because the AirPods Max use Apple’s older H1 chip. However, the company added lossless audio over USB-C in April, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity in Apple’s entire lineup. \nRead my full AirPods Max (Lightning) review.\nWhat’s coming next\nWith Apple’s fall hardware event in the rearview mirror, we’re at a point where the company’s lineup seems settled (for now). Apple doesn’t upgrade its entry-level AirPods line on an annual basis like some of its other products, and the Pro 3 just hit the market. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have gone relatively unchanged since their release in 2020, with Apple adding a USB-C model and new color options last year. It’s possible that we’ll see a camera-equipped pair of AirPods with support for Apple Intelligence in the future — a report from last year indicated as much — but it’s not likely to be anytime soon.\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted to reflect current pricing / availability and new related links.",

      "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with most original Switch games, which is a great feature to tide early adopters (like me!) over until more Switch 2 exclusives launch. The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on Amazon, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.\nSamsung P9 microSD Express Card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $99.99 $94.99 at Amazon (512GB, with on-page coupon)\n\nThe current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is a card from Onn, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.\nAs for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment requires 43.4GB of space, while Silksong only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade requires a 93GB download.\nEven physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.",

      "title": "Co-Captain Allows Ships to Share Important Navigational Data",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ship-navigation-orca-ai",
      "description": "A new onboard system allows ocean-going vessels to share real-time sea condition data, giving crews early warnings and helping them navigate more safely. The system will analyze data related to navigation, vessel behavior, and the environment to give ship crews guidance at sea.\nWhile casualties from ship collisions and groundings have declined, the overall number of maritime incidents are on the rise, up 22 percent in recent years, driven by aging vessels and equipment failures.\nOrca AI, a London-based autonomous maritime navigation company, has introduced a software feature called Co-Captain, aiming to reduce those incidents. Co-Captain is an addition to the company’s existing SeaPod real-time decision support system, which bridge officers can use while at sea to navigate better.\n  Co-Captain provides information about severe weather, including recommendations to specific ships based on their size and shape.Orca AI\n“Co-Captain is a network of vessels using Orca to capture events worldwide and share insights. Think of it like the navigation app you use in your car: it tells you about traffic or roadblocks in advance so you can adjust your route,” says Yarden Gross, the CEO and co-founder of Orca AI.\nGross says that Co-Captain frequently collects data from sensors on board vessels and sends it to the cloud to improve ship performance and safety for vessels globally.\nOrca AI’s Maritime Solutions\nOrcaAI, founded in 2018 by Gross and Dor Raviv, the CTO, began with SeaPod and Fleet View. While SeaPod collects and analyzes data on individual ships, Fleet View gathers that data in the cloud to give fleet managers on shore better visibility into larger operations.\nCo-Captain integrates with the existing system to provide proactive insights to improve fleet performance and safety. Today, ship officers rely on tools like radar, the automatic identification system (AIS), and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) monitor the positions of other vessels and avoid collisions, but much of the work remains manual.\n  Co-Captain identifies various navigational hazards to a ship’s crew. The crew can also manually tag obstacles or other concerns.Orca AI\nGross described Co-Captain as the next generation of AIS, the network that transmits basic information like a ship’s position, name, and heading over very high frequency (VHF) signals ranging from 30 to 300 megahertz. Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship’s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels’ crews.\n“Every ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node—the vessel itself—has an onboard AI platform. This platform collects data from multiple sensors in real time,” Gross says. Using cameras and computer vision, the AI model can detect bad weather, low visibility, tall waves, or strong winds, then the platform analyzes the data to provide tailored guidance.\nAll data is anonymized. Gross says that a ship’s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. “By anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.”\nGross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.\nThe company’s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship’s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations. The platform is already in use on over 1,200 vessels.",

      "description": "GTA 6 artwork | Image: Rockstar Games\t\n\nIt’s been over a decade and two console generations since GTA V came out, and its sequel is still a work in progress. GTA VI has faced multiple delays, with developer Rockstar Games bumping back its predicted release date twice, first to May 26th, 2026, then again to November 19th, 2026, a full year after its originally planned release window of fall 2025. \nDespite the delays, we have gotten some early glimpses of GTA VI. Its most recent trailer offers a look at the game’s protagonists, Jason and Lucia. The main story will follow the pair around Vice City as they attempt to navigate a criminal conspiracy after a job goes south.  \nGTA VI has had a rocky road to release so far, with leaks early on and more recently, developer Rockstar facing accusations of union busting after firing more than 30 employees just days before announcing GTA VI’s most recent delay.\nRead on below for all of the news and updates about Grand Theft Auto VI.\nGrand Theft Auto VI launch delayed until November 2026\n\t\t\t\nRockstar claims fired employees were leaking company information.\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI developer accused of union busting in mass firings\n\t\t\t\nAm I the only person that didn’t watch the GTA VI trailer?\n\t\t\t\nRockstar says new GTA VI trailer was ‘equal parts gameplay and cutscenes’\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI’s second trailer sets up its Bonnie and Clyde story\n\t\t\t\nLet’s rewatch the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI release delayed to May 2026\n\t\t\t\nGTA V is Twitch’s most watched game of 2024\n\t\t\t\nGTA V is coming back to Game Pass, again.\n\t\t\t\nRockstar’s working on bringing Roblox creators to GTA VI\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI is still coming this fall.\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025\n\t\t\t\nIt’s RTO for the GTA VI devs.\n\t\t\t\nGTA Online will no longer support Rockstar Editor on old-gen consoles.\n\t\t\t\nY’all really liked that trailer, huh?\n\t\t\t\nDigital Foundry posted a nearly 37-minute analysis of the GTA VI trailer.\n\t\t\t\nThe GTA VI trailer is already breaking viewership records on YouTube.\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI isn’t launching on PC.\n\t\t\t\nThe first GTA VI trailer is here\n\t\t\t\nThis is where you can watch the first GTA VI trailer tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\nSpeak softly, then drop a hype-ass trailer.\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI’s first trailer will debut in December\n\t\t\t\nRockstar confirms hack, says work on GTA VI will ‘continue as planned’\n\t\t\t\nGTA 6 gameplay leaks online in 90 videos\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI could finally let you blow up Miami as a woman in 2024\n\t\t\t\nRockstar finally confirms it’s working on the next Grand Theft Auto",

      "description": "Robot vacuums that can both mop and sweep your floors have improved significantly in recent years. While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor-sweeping bots.\nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nBest robot vacuum and mop\nDeebot X8 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-cleaning roller mop\nExtendable mop\nExcellent obstacle avoidance\nSmaller dock\n\nLimited mop lift\nHeavy, struggles with transitions\nSingle roller brush\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $839.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $1099.99 at Ecovacs\n $1099.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter \nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1,599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $499.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. It can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $649.99 at Dreame (with code BFX40UA)\n $1199.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $1199.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nEufy Omni S1 Pro\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong roller mop\nSleek, futuristic design\nDual side brushes\nSquare shape helps with corners\n\nMiddling vacuum performance\nNo self-cleaning base\nNo mop extension\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $594.99 at Eufy (with code WSLDV2LXEBGE)\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Amazon\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nNarwal Freo Z Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSuperb mopping\nGreat obstacle avoidance\nExcellent dirt detection\nSelf-cleans its washboard\nVery quiet\n\nMinimal mop lift\nEdge cleaning just okay\nUses a lot of water\nApp is unreliable\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n $1499.99 $947.99 at Amazon (at checkout)\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Narwal (with code BFPREFRZU)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nSwitchBot S10\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAlmost hands-free\nExcellent roller mop\nSelf-cleans\nBattery-powered water station\nSupports Matter\n\nBig and wide\nCan’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum\nShort battery life\nLow suction power\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $456 at Switchbot (with code BXBX58)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently released the Switchbot S20 ($480 $799.99), which looks like the Pro model that made its debut at CES. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($949.99, 1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999.99 $2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vacuum occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent model with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads that it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($949.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($799.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($849.99 $999.99) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\niRobot also recently introduced an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705, the Roomba Max 705 Combo, which is available for $1,299.99. Like the Max 705, it features dual rubber roller brushes that are resistant to tangling, along with AI-powered obstacle detection. It also comes with a unique roller mop cover that automatically deploys as it cleans, as well as a design that allows the mop to extend into corners and clean along wall edges.\nPriced at $750 (with code WS24T2352111), Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe recently launched Narwal Flow costs $1,299.99 with code NFLOW $1,499.99, and features the company’s first roller mop, which can also extend. We haven’t spent any time with it yet, but Narwal claims it can easily tackle thick, fluffy carpets thanks to its deep carpet boost mode.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. This is easily one of the smartest cleaners I’ve tried, with great mapping and cleaning performance that feels surprisingly close to what a person would typically achieve. It’s also simple to run, easy to maintain, and reliable. We’ll have a full review soon, but for now, here’s some video of it in action.\nThe $1,099.99 Eureka J20 features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction, but it is no longer available on Eureka’s website. The new J15 Max Ultra ($1,199) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,049.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 ($480 with code FLFL44, $799.99), which resembles the Pro model announced at CES earlier this year, is now available. It’s essentially the successor to our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum, the Switchbot S10, with an extendable roller mop / side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags, either.\nThe $299.99 $549.99 Roborock Q10 S5 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop delivers 10,000Pa of suction power and uses a sonic mop that scrubs floors 3,000 times per minute. It also comes with a 2.7-liter self-emptying base that can hold up to 70 days’ worth of debris, along with room-specific cleaning, no-go zones, and customizable cleaning schedules.\nThe $1,199.99 $1,599.99 Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete features a roller-style mopping system that continuously cleans itself in real time. Its companion model, the Aqua10 Ultra Track Complete, adds hot-water mopping and automatically adds cleaning solution as it moves about, so you don’t have to stop and refill anything.\nThe $1,799.99 $1,999.99 Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra comes with a multi-mop switching dock, one that lets it automatically swap between nylon scrub pads, sponge pads, and thermal mop pads based on where it’s cleaning. Its three-solution compartment also holds separate cleaners aimed at tackling pet odors, wood floors, and general messes, which the robovac will dispense on its own depending on the situation.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed the Roborock S8 Plus, and added info regarding the Roborock Q10 S5 Plus, the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete, and the Dreame Matrix10 Ultra.

      "description": "Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk’s staggering new pay package, in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO’s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. \nThe vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days.\nMusk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of “Elon! Elon!” and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” he said. \nThe proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September, would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. \nIn the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating — and controlling — a “robot army.”\n\nMusk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years.\n\n\nThe vote was opposed by some of Tesla’s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. \nMusk’s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla’s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld her ruling blocking it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling spurred Musk to engineer a proposal to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, which shareholders also approved. \nThe new award comes as the board continues to push the message that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm. In reality, Tesla’s position is shakier than ever. Musk’s support for President Donald Trump and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and cancel humanitarian aid programs spawned a nationwide protest movement and a steep drop in sales. The expiration of the federal EV tax credit is expected to lead to an even further drop in sales. \nWhether Musk can achieve these audacious goals set out in the pay package seems increasingly at odds with his approach to the technology. Tesla rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The cars still all feature safety monitors, either in the driver or passenger seat — though Musk has said they could be removed by the end of the year. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a consumer flop. And competition from other automakers, especially those in China, has been shrinking Tesla’s market share and sapping its resources.",

      "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI is being delayed again: it will now launch on November 19th, 2026.\n“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar Games says. “We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”\nPreviously, GTA VI was set to launch on May 26th, 2026. Before that, Rockstar planned to release the game in 2025. It will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.\n“When we set a date, we really do believe in it,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick tells The Game Business. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that’s exactly what happened. We feel really good about this release date. It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.”\nGTA VI will take place in Vice City and stars two protagonists, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. “Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,” according to Rockstar’s description of the second trailer for the game, which was released in May. “But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.” Rockstar’s first GTA VI trailer debuted in late 2023.\nLast week, Rockstar was accused of union busting after firing 30 to 40 employees. A Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg that it took action against a “small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum” and that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”",

      "title": "Menifee’s EV-Powered Homes: A New Era in Energy Independence",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/evs-keep-homes-lit",
      "description": "In Menifee, Calif., six newly built homes are testing a first for North America: electric vehicles that can power houses through the Combined Charging System (CCS) high-power DC charging standard. Each home uses a host Kia EV9 electric vehicle connected to a Wallbox Quasar 2 bidirectional charger, allowing the car’s 100-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery to run essential circuits during blackouts or periods when electricity prices are high. The setup is the first residential vehicle-to-home (V2H) system in the United States that uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. The CCS is the charging system commonly used in European and North American residential and public charging facilities.\nSince July, the homes’ smart electrical panels have automatically managed two-way power flow—charging vehicles from the grid or rooftop solar, then reversing the flow of energy when needed. The system isolates each home from the grid during an outage, preventing any current from flowing into external power lines and endangering utility crews and nearby equipment.\n“This project is demonstrating that bidirectional charging with CCS can work in occupied homes,” says Scott Samuelsen, founding director of the Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP) at the University of California, Irvine, which is monitoring the two-year trial. “It’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people but also strengthen the energy system.”\n\n\nMenifee means a lot\nFor more than a decade, two-way charging has been available—but mostly restricted to Japan. Back in 2012 the Nissan’s LEAF-to-Home program proved the idea viable after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but that Nissan system relied on the or CHAdeMO standard, little used outside of Japan. Most North American [and European manufacturers chose CCS instead—a standard that, until recently, supported only one-way fast DC charging.\nThat distinction makes Menifee’s V2H-enabled neighborhood notable: it’s the first CCS-based V2H deployment in occupied homes, giving researchers real-world field data on a technology that’s been long trapped in pilot programs. The pairing of the Kia EV9 SUV with Wallbox’s commercially available Quasar 2 can deliver up to 12 kilowatts of power from the vehicle to the home.\nIt’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people, but also strengthen the energy system.”\n –Scott Samuelsen, UC Irvine\n\n Elsewhere, momentum towards commercial V2H has slowed. Ford’s F-150 Lightning supports home backup through Sunrun, but Sunrun equipment is not CCS-compatible. What’s more, Ford has announced a production pause for the pickup truck, which has delayed expansion. GM’s Ultium Home—a  V2H system that works with the automaker’s Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra EVs— faces similar setbacks. Tesla’s PowerShare V2H feature is still stuck in a limited, early commercial rollout, with bidirectional compatibility restricted to the company’s Cybertruck. Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.\n\n\nWhy CCS Matters\nWhen electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).\nBidirectional operation wasn’t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS’s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations—ISO 15118—didn’t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, ISO 15118-20, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.\nWallbox’s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its 12-kW power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says Aleix Maixé Sas, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.\n  As the company’s name humbly suggests, Wallbox’s chargers look like plain old boxes—although they contain high-tech components.Wallbox\nThe Menifee blueprint\nEach of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh SunVault stationary battery from SunPower. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9’s battery. When the grid fails—or when energy prices spike—the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.\nThis past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that “the vehicle adds a major resilience feature,” according to Samuelsen, who is the Menifee project manager. “It can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.”\nEngineering the Two-Way Home\nHome builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.\nA Glimpse of the Energy Future\nAnalysts expect double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee’s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.\nWhen EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear—and with it, old concepts regarding who’s an energy supplier and who’s a customer.\n#",

      "description": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple (128GB)\n $599.99 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $599.99 at Verizon (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the newer iPhone Air. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming, and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead our full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best cheap Android phone\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Google (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $550.85 at Amazon\n $599.99 $549.99 at OnePlus (with code EARLYBF)\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead our full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice available in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nThe Nothing Phone 3A and 3A Pro are currently available in beta for $379 and $459, respectively. The 3A and 3A Pro are mainly differentiated by their cameras. Both phones feature a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide; however, the 3A Pro’s prominent round camera housing includes a 3x periscope telephoto lens, while the 3A offers a standard 2x zoom. They also offer improved hardware over the Phone 2A and a new feature called the Essential Space, which allows you to store and index your miscellaneous screenshots, voice memos, and photographs through a dedicated button.\nWhat’s coming next\nMotorola is planning to release two additional devices before the end of the year. The $169 Moto G Play (2026) is set to release on November 13th, while the $199 Moto G (2026) is slated for December 11th. Both devices pack a 5,200mAh battery, an IP52 rating for water and dust resistance, a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The devices also launch with Android 16, with support for features like Google Gemini and Circle to Search. The main difference between the two is that the Moto G features a 50-megapixel camera, whereas the G Play has a 32-megapixel shooter.\nThe OnePlus 15 is set to launch in the US on November 13th, although its exact price remains unknown. However, we do know what the device will offer when it becomes available, including a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, a huge 7,300mAh battery, and a speedy 165Hz refresh rate display. It also features a triple 50-megapixel camera setup, along with a more durable IP68 and IP69K rating for enduring high-pressure water jets.\nNow that Google’s flagship Pixel 10 lineup has been released, we’re starting to see early murmurs regarding the Pixel 10A. So far, not much is known about the device, though some leaked CAD renders suggest it will be a spitting image of the excellent Pixel 9A. If history is anything to go by, the entry-level 10A will borrow some key features from the 10, meaning it’s possible we’ll see the more affordable handset launch with Google’s latest Tensor G5 processor.\nUpdate, November 6th: Updated pricing / availability and added info about the Moto G Play (2026), the Moto G (2026), the OnePlus 15, and the Google Pixel 10A.

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/815806/senate-resolution-trump-us-ai-technology-china",
      "description": "A group of senators is urging President Donald Trump to preserve the US’s edge in AI development by denying China access to its most advanced chips and models. The bipartisan resolution, submitted by Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), comes just days after Trump walked back a statement that suggested he would consider allowing Nvidia to sell its powerful Blackwell chip in China. \nThe resolution, which is cosponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Dave McCormick (R-PA), brings attention to China’s “efforts to close the AI gap and leap ahead” of the US when it comes to developing and deploying frontier AI models. It adds that China’s “inability to make and access computing power is the main impediment to its progress.” To keep the US in the lead, the senators call on the government to urge US companies to continue offering “priority access” to its most advanced AI chips, cloud infrastructure, and models to allies, while preventing China and other adversaries from obtaining the technology.\n“We cannot allow China to leap ahead of us and bolster their weapons capabilities, maximize their cyberattacks against American industry, and threaten long-term U.S. economic and national security,” Senator Coons says in a statement. “This bipartisan resolution sets us on a path toward a different future — one in which frontier AI systems are built in the United States by American companies.”\nThe Senators want the government to continue enforcing export controls that prevent US chipmakers like Nvidia from selling their most advanced chips to China, a policy put at risk last month when Trump said he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping about selling Nvidia’s Blackwell chip in the country.\nIn an interview with The Financial Times this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that “China is going to win the AI race,” citing lower energy costs and fewer regulations. He later followed up with an additional statement, saying China is just “nanoseconds behind America in AI.” Earlier this year, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shivers through the industry with the launch of cost-efficient AI models that perform similarly to data-hungry rivals from companies like OpenAI.\nTrump has since struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD that will require the companies to pay the government a 15 percent commission on the stripped-down chips they sell to China.",

      "description": "This article is crossposted from IEEE Spectrum’s careers newsletter. Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free!\nAt its core, engineering is an act of creation. This is why many of us chose to become engineers: We love to build things.\nBut especially if you have a private sector job, it’s easy to forget that passion to build as you climb up the corporate ladder. Somewhere between quarterly planning meetings and incident retrospectives, we often lose the joy of creation in our corporate jobs. Large companies require a level of bureaucracy and specialization that is often at odds with building something new.\nThat’s why I frequently recommend burned-out engineers to do something very simple: Start a side project. During 15 years working across various tech stacks and companies, this has been the most straightforward, underrated, and powerful way to regain my excitement at work.\nBeyond rekindling a passion for creation, side projects have many other benefits. Side projects let us explore new technologies or problem spaces. We can leverage newer ideas that our companies may be hesitant to adopt. And you don’t need to get buy-in from a manager or explain the business justification. Start using a technology simply because you want to learn about it. \nWhen you build something through a side project, your depth of understanding is far greater than just following a tutorial or reading about it. I can attribute many of my career opportunities to the projects I’ve built and published outside of my day job. Some of these projects, like my career growth platform Taro, even turn into companies!\nWe’ve entered the golden age for side projects because they’re so much more accessible. Compared to a decade ago, it’s significantly easier to research, build, and deploy your creation. Even compared to two years ago, you’re much less likely now to waste hours wrestling with some configuration rabbit hole. Just ask ChatGPT or Gemini for help!\nThe benefits of a personal project are real: passion, learning, career growth, and fun. And they’re easier than ever to create. Now’s the time to create your side project portfolio.\n—Rahul\nHow to Land a Job in Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry is growing, opening up new opportunities for engineers—and you don’t necessarily need a background in quantum physics to take these positions. So what skills do you need? See five key tips for breaking into the field from recruiters and researchers now working in quantum computing jobs. \nRead more here.\nEmpowering Women in the Power Industry\nMini Thomas has built a highly successful career as an expert in power systems and smart grids—thanks in part, she says, to support from her family. Now a professor of electrical engineering in New Delhi, Thomas mentors women in the power industry, helping to expand the female leadership pipeline in India. \nRead more here.\nAre Kids Still Looking for Careers in Tech?\nThe growth of AI and changes in funding for scientific research have spurred uncertainty for young people considering careers in STEM.

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud",
      "description": "Have you received a notification from your bank or credit card company alerting you to suspicious activity on your account and requesting you confirm a purchase? You probably wondered how the bank suspected the charge wasn’t legitimate.\nCredit card companies use a variety of methods to detect fraud, which is the most common type of identity theft and is on the rise, according to Experian, one of the major consumer credit information services.\nPankaj Gupta\n\nEmployer \nDiscover, in Raleigh, N.C.\nTitle \nData engineering manager\nMember grade \nSenior member\nAlma mater \nChristian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India\nTo help prevent unauthorized transactions, IEEE Senior Member Pankaj Gupta is developing tools using data integration, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time account monitoring. Gupta is a manager of data and analytics engineering for Discover, and he works from Raleigh, N.C.\n“The innovations my fraud department has developed have helped my organization respond to threats faster and adapt more easily to future needs,” he says.\nThis year, he received Discover’s President’s Award, the company’s highest employee recognition. It is given to those who have achieved outstanding business results while demonstrating the company’s values.\nGupta also became an invited member of the Forbes Technology Council, a community of experienced leaders across industries, selected based on their professional achievements and leadership experience.\nHe says he enjoys his job but says he never meant to work in financial services, a field where he has built a nearly two-decade-long career.\nFrom electrical engineering to software development\nAs a youngster, he was curious about how things worked and would take apart gadgets his father brought home.\n“My father worked at BSNL, a government telecom organization, and often took me to his office,” Gupta says. “There I would watch phones in operation and telecom operators connecting trunk calls. At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.”\nWhile at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.\nTaking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.\n“Growing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the Bamleshwari Temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,” he says.\nHe also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory’s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.\n“I noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,” he says. “This exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.”\nIn 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the Christian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.\nIn India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company Satyam Computer Services, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor’s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.\nThat’s when he pivoted to software engineering.\nGupta says that although software development wasn’t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.\nHe still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn’t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.\nHis time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.\n“It’s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,” he says.\nUsing AI and machine learning to combat fraud\nGupta left Satyam in 2011 to join Mphasis, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for Wipro Technologies in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.\nHe moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at JPMorgan Chase in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank’s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.\n“This greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,” he says.\nHe also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.\n“I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.”\n“This allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,” he says. “These innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.”\nHe joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.\nAI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer’s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.\nIn simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.\nStaying connected to tech pros\nGupta joined IEEE in 2023 “to connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,” he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.\n“Membership has helped me access world-class research through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library,” he says. “It also provided me an opportunity to attend conferences and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.”\nAI’s impact on engineering\nHis advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.\n“Technology is changing very rapidly,” he says. “What is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.”\nHe predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.\n“Engineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,” he says. “I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\n“Focus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.\n“Build your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.”",

The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "description": "It’s a little after 6:30 on a brisk July morning in a stone hut high in the Italian Alps. A gently hissing wood fire is leaking some warmth out of a brick oven. Gathered near it, around a big wooden table, some of Europe’s brightest young lepidopterists are doing what they do best: arguing in Spanish, Italian, and English about moths.\n The Alte Pforzheimer Hütte, a stone house originally built in 1901, served as a base camp for the lepidopterists hunting rare moths in the Italian Alps.Luigi Avantaggiato\nScattered across the top of the table are dozens of moths in plastic specimen jars, the harvest of the previous night’s trapping. At one end of the table, Gioele Moro of the Czech Academy of Sciences is gently prying loose moths from the depths of a trap. At the other end, Laura Torrado-Blanco of the University of Oviedo’s entomological collection is paging through Lepidoptera guide books. She’s using the books to identify species—up here at 2,300 meters, there is no Internet connection.\n A few of the scores of moths captured on a single night at a site in the Italian Alps are lined up on a bench in the stone hut. Researchers will identify the moths’ species and some of the insects will be sent on for tissue sampling and eventual genome sequencing. Luigi Avantaggiato\nLooking up from a book, she notices me noticing the big butterfly tattoo on her left arm. “Chapman’s ringlet,” she tells me. “Erebia palarica,” she adds reflexively.\nPep Lancho Silva, a doctoral student at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, extends a finger toward me with a spectacular creature on it: a large bone-white moth, with a black head and big black splotches on its wings. Torrado-Blanco is pretty sure it’s Arctia flavia, a species of tiger moth found only in rarefied air. If so, it’s precisely the kind of insect they came up here, to this chilly hut on the edge of a crystalline Alpine pond, to capture.\n A yellow tiger moth, Arctia flavia, is among the catch at the stone hut, at an altitude of 2,300 meters. \n At the crack of dawn in the stone hut, researchers [from left] Eric Toro Delgado, Laura Torrado-Blanco, Mónica Doblas-Bajo, and Gioele Moro (standing) unpack and examine the moths captured during the previous night.Luigi Avantaggiato\nLepidopterists have trapped, identified, and classified moths and butterflies for centuries. But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It’s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of Project Psyche, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. Psyche is part of a larger effort, the Darwin Tree of Life project, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the Earth BioGenome Project. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of all of Earth’s roughly 1.8 million organisms—every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that’s made up of cells that have a nucleus.\nRelated: The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything\nNone of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it’s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal—to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035—won’t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.\n\n\n\nBut the project’s success may ultimately hinge on functions other than sequencing. For example, after a creature’s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data—consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs—must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, before an organism’s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it’s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.\nHow Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? \nWhen I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to Charlotte Wright and Joana Meier at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, England. The reasons, they tell me, span a range from pure science to completely commercial.\n \n At the Hotel Tyrol in the Italian Alps, lepidopterist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, dissects the yellow tiger moth captured near the stone hut. Packed with liquid nitrogen, the tissue samples will subsequently be sent to the institute in England for genome sequencing.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe earliest Lepidoptera appeared 250 million to 300 million years ago. By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, “we can find out how they have evolved and how they’ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.”\nThose genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell’s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature’s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the Atlas blue butterfly, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.\nThe Atlas blue is “a very good example of something that’s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,” says Meier. “What we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications”—thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. “Then we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, ‘What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that’s broken?’ ”\n Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.Luigi Avantaggiato\nAnd it’s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data. One practical aspect of these studies has to do with moths’ impact on agriculture. “There’s billions and billions of euros lost because agriculturally, some species do a lot of damage,” says Meier.\nAdds Wright, “Pests are moving to new regions where previously they weren’t present and causing huge losses because the crops there haven’t been developed to be protected against these new species.” The reasons why some species succeed in a new area as climate changes, and are able to adapt and thrive, are also understandable only by studying many genomes—of the creatures that succeed, as well as the ones that don’t. “It’s kind of a dynamic situation, of monitoring these pests’ movements,” says Wright.\n  Shortly before sunset, Gioele Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, sets up a moth trap on a mountain slope above the stone hut (the Alte Pforzheimer Hütte) in the Italian Alps.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \nThat, it turns out, takes a small army of grad students, researchers, and even citizen-scientists. Indeed, one of the goals of this expedition is to develop and refine best practices in collecting samples for genome sequencing and to train a cadre of young lepidopterists, who have varying levels of familiarity with the technologies of genome sequencing and annotation. On such techniques rests the success of not only Project Psyche, but also, ultimately, the Earth BioGenome Project.\nTo Catch a Moth, You’ve Got to Think Like One\nIt’s late in the afternoon of our first day in the high-altitude hut. Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, is standing on a steeply raked mountainside in a dazzling sea of wildflowers—purple, yellow, lavender, crimson—that are gently swaying in the fading amber light. He’s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he’s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it’s black). He’s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth’s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.\nThe objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different “microenvironments,” he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there’s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.\n  Genetics researcher Noé Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \n“Over there”—he points across the valley to the opposite slope. “It faces north. See? No flowers. That’s what I mean by different microenvironments.” We’re perched on the south-facing slope, about 80 meters above the valley bottom, on a trail about as wide as a toaster oven.\nHours later, after dodging cow patties the size of dinner plates and gaping holes leading to marmot burrows, the locations are chosen and the traps are set. There’s one on the south slope, one on the north, and one near the fast-flowing stream between them. As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.\nAt the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night’s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they’ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The Wellcome Trust is the lead sponsor of both Project Psyche and the Darwin Tree of Life project.\n \n  Lepidopterist Joana Meier of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, packs the abdomen of a moth into a vial for shipment from Italy to the institute in England. A bar code on the vial contains information about the sample and allows it to be tracked on its journey to the lab. Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe plastic tubes are packed in liquid-nitrogen-cooled shipping containers for the trip to Wellcome Sanger. DNA begins to break down almost immediately after death, especially in soft tissues. So the cryogenics are necessary to ensure that the samples arrive at Wellcome Sanger with as little degradation as possible.\nMicromoths Are a Looming Challenge \nNiklas Wahlberg of Lund University, in Sweden, is officially a “sampling hub leader” of Project Psyche. Unofficially, he’s one of the select few grizzled veterans here in Malles Venosta helping to mentor the young researchers, whose attendance is being funded through a European Union program called European Cooperation in Science and Technology.\n  Niklas Wahlberg, an evolutionary biologist at Lund University in Sweden, captures a moth in a plastic container at a trapping site along an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nWahlberg is an unabashed fan of moths. It’s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it’s just that he’s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can’t even fly at night or in the rain. “Butterflies are just day-flying moths,” Wahlberg quips. “People think of them as different and special, but they’re not.”\nIn this new era of mass genome sequencing, they’re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera—about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 European Lepidoptera species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg’s reckoning. And they’ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.\nSo the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the micromoths.\nMicromoths have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; the smallest can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as “macromoths”). There are a lot of micromoths—at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.\n  Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThat’s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes. Fortunately, though, it’s a problem for which there is a technological solution: DNA barcoding.\nBesides the DNA in the nuclei of every cell, there exists other genetic material, called mitochondrial DNA, outside of the nucleus. It’s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there’s a mitochondrial gene, called CO1, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. “We have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,” Wahlberg says. “And only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.”\nDNA barcoding was invented in the early 2000s by Paul Hebert and colleagues at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.\n \n  Staﬀ Scientist Silvia Pérez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing. To minimize degradation of the DNA in the samples, they are stored at -80 °C.Luigi Avantaggiato\nGenetic material is isolated from that tissue, and then a CO1 gene is “amplified,” or replicated into many millions of copies, using a standard biotechnical technique called polymerase chain reaction. That material is sequenced using any one of the dozen or more types of sequencing machines available to researchers.\nFor barcoding purposes, typical DNA sequences of the CO1 gene run between 400 and 800 base pairs. But lately researchers have been developing techniques that use shorter or longer barcodes. The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have 100 to 250 base pairs. Conversely, “super-barcodes,” which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species—exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.\nWhy RNA Will Make Annotating Faster\nWhile the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project. Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly, Lycaena helle, a creature that was first studied in 1775. They described their efforts in a paper published by F1000Research.\nThis was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome’s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.\n  Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.Luigi Avantaggiato\nToday, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the thousands of genes within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. “You take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, ‘Ah, look here. There’s a gene that starts here,” says Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG), in Barcelona. “ ‘And this is the structure of the gene.’ And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,” of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.\nGut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or ribonucleic acid. When a gene specifies, or “expresses,” a protein, RNA acts as the “messenger,” carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.\nThe breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article “The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything, in IEEE Spectrum.”] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations—CNAG, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at Pompeu Fabra University, and the University of Barcelona—and from Andorra Research and Innovation, in Sant Julià de Lòria.\nThe genome of the female violet copper butterfly, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also very difficult to predict by computational means. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says Roderic Guigó Serra, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.\n“Long-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,” he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, “we get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,” Serra declares.\n  At the Guigò Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. Luigi Avantaggiato\nHis group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species—including humans. They’re doing this through Gencode, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, “reference” annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it—particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying 18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes. “These genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,” says Serra.\nResearchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world’s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe’s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.\nIt’s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. “My loathings are simple,” he wrote in 1973. “Stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music. My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing and butterfly hunting.”",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "title": "Volcanologists Turn to a High-Tech Suitcase to Study Eruptions",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/volcano-monitoring-stromboli-skate",
      "description": "When hundreds of volcanologists gathered in Geneva last July for the world’s largest volcanology conference, Italy’s Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) drew particular attention. INGV was presenting results from five years of very close range observations of Stromboli, one of the Mediterranean’s most monitored volcanoes. Its frequent small eruptions make it both a natural laboratory for vulcanologists and a constant safety concern for the island’s roughly 500 residents and thousands of tourists.\nThe last three years of close observations were made possible by a portable observatory called the Setup for the Kinematic Acquisition of Explosive Eruptions, or SKATE. The suitcase-sized system is packed with tech that captures eruptions at hundreds of frames per second, synchronously recording their roar and their heat.\nFilming and analyzing an explosive eruption up close for hours, while capturing data about its heat, sound, and motion, has historically been tricky and dangerous. But that’s the data scientists need to understand how eruptions work and evolve over time. SKATE makes that process both safer and simpler by autonomously recording synchronized streams of observatory data and minimizing the time researchers need to spend on a volcano’s slopes.\n“Explosive eruptions are extremely fast processes with particles the size of a truck or a grain of dust that can travel from a few meters per second to supersonic speeds,” says Jacopo Taddeucci, a senior researcher at INGV. “You need cameras shooting hundreds of frames per second and instruments that can see, hear, and feel the eruption at once to understand cause and effect.”\nAside from Stromboli, SKATE has been tested on the nearby Mount Etna, as well as on Guatemala’s Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live near active volcanoes, many of which are without any monitoring system. INGV is now planning deployments on other volcanoes, including Mount Yasur in Vanuatu, known as the “Lighthouse of the Pacific” for its near continuous eruptions featuring rhythmic bursts of incandescent lava and gas.\nSKATE’s Innovative Volcanology Technology\nSKATE was assembled by Technology Equipment Engineering Solutions (TEES), an Italian manufacturer of custom scientific instruments and Dewesoft, a Slovenian company specializing in high-speed data acquisition and measurement systems. The two companies followed INGV’s specifications to pack an entire observatory into a rigid polypropylene shell on a €50,000 (about US $58,000) budget.\nSKATE is the streamlined successor to an earlier INGV prototype known as FAMoUS (Fast Multiparametric Setup), which first proved the value of combining high-speed, thermal, and acoustic sensors. But it also came with serious drawbacks: It was heavy and bulky, took a long time to install on site, and required manual triggering, which forced researchers to spend hours in hazardous zones to capture only a handful of sequences.\n  SKATE is more portable and easier to deploy than its predecessor, a system called FAMoUS.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nInside SKATE, a waterproof PC coordinates a thermal camera recording at 32 frames per second, and a high-speed camera that records bursts of footage when it detects sudden temperature spikes. Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE’s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.\n“The real challenge wasn’t plugging in cameras and sensors,” says Alessia Longo, an engineer at Dewesoft. “It was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.”\nThat data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on solar panels and replaceable batteries.\n“The creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,” says Piergiorgio Scarlato, INGV’s research director.\nModular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring\nPlaced between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli’s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. \nThe design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify sulfur dioxide emissions. It’s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano’s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.\n“Depth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,” says Scarlato “By understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.”\nOn Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs—chunks of lava flung out during an eruption—and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.\nSKATE’s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis\nSKATE isn’t a 24/7 alarm. It’s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater—such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments—to make better sense of their signals.\n  A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nData from SKATE is helping scientists test hypotheses about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can’t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.\nSKATE’s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent research campaign on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli’s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.\nDespite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. “Working in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,” says Scarlato. “The difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.”",

      "description": "This article was originally published by Canary Media.\nEavor, an advanced-geothermal startup, says it has significantly reduced drilling times and improved technologies at its nearly online project in Germany—milestones that should help it drive down the costs of harnessing clean energy from the ground.\nIn late October, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel “closed-loop” geothermal systems in hotter and deeper locations than conventional projects can access.\n“Much like wind and solar have come down the cost curve, much like unconventional shale [oil and gas] have come down the cost curve, we now have a technical proof-point that we’ve done that in Europe,” Jeanine Vany, a cofounder and executive vice president of corporate affairs at Eavor, said from the Geothermal Rising conference in Reno, Nevada.\nEavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms—including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy—are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.\nThe industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.\nEavor’s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany \nEavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund. For its first “loop,” the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly 2.8 miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells—like tines of a fork—that each stretch 1.8 miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.\nOperations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March 2026. All told, the system will supply 8.2 megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and 64 MW of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. \nIn its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 100 days to complete—a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $100,000 a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by 50 percent.\nFor example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.\nOn top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35 percent, Vany said.\nThe Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches—like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada—are also scaling up.\nChallenges in Geothermal Drilling\nEnhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater—though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.\nBut the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.\n“While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,” Tester said. “You can get energy out of the ground; it’s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?”\nVany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the “levelized cost of heat” in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $50 and $100 per megawatt-hour thermal in the region’s volatile energy market, she said.\n“After we’ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,” Vany added. “And that’s the purpose of the Geretsried project.”",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/thermal-management-chips",
      "description": "Diamonds, lasers, and oil aren’t the first things you may think of when considering ways to keep chips and computers cool. But as modern chip designs pack and stack more transistors into ever smaller spaces, heat has emerged as a critical problem.\nTo solve it, the semiconductor industry is throwing everything at the wall. What sticks could enable the scaling of not only AI data centers but also a host of applications in consumer electronics, communications, and military equipment.\n\nThis article is part of The Hot, Hot Future of Chips.\n\nAs Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore explained to me between bites of a cold tongue sandwich at the 2nd Ave Deli, near IEEE Spectrum’s office, better thermal management is essential for next-generation nodes.\n“As we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse,” said Moore, who has been covering semiconductors on and off for a quarter century.\nFor the special report in this issue, Moore teamed up with Associate Editor Dina Genkina, who oversees our computing coverage. They talked to engineers at IEEE conferences like IEDM and Supercomputing about how technologists are getting the heat out in new and surprising ways.\n“As we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse.” —Samuel K. Moore\nThe first step to solving an engineering problem is characterizing it precisely. In “Will Heat Cause a Moore’s Law Meltdown?”, James Myers, of Imec in Cambridge, England, describes how transistors entering commercial production in the 2030s will have a power density that raises temperatures by 9 °C. In data centers where hot chips are crammed together by the millions, this increase could force hardware to shut down or risk permanent damage.\nIn “Next-Gen AI Needs Liquid Cooling”, Genkina takes readers on a deep dive into four contenders to beat this heat with liquids: cold plates with a circulating water-glycol mixture attached directly to the hottest chips; a version of that tech in which a specialized dielectric fluid boils into vapor; dunking entire servers in tanks filled with dielectric oil; and doing the same in tanks of boiling dielectric fluid.\nAlthough liquid cooling works well, “it’s also more expensive and introduces additional points of failure,” Moore cautioned. “But when you’re consuming kilowatts and kilowatts in such a small space, you do what you have to do.”\nAs mind-blowing as servers in boiling oil may seem, the two other articles in this issue focus on even more radical cooling technologies. One involves using lasers to cool chips. The technique, outlined by Jacob Balma and Alejandro Rodriguez from the Minnesota-based startup Maxwell Labs, involves converting phonons (vibrations in a crystal lattice that carry heat) into photons that can be piped away. The authors contend that their technique “can target hot spots as they form, with laser precision.”\nMeanwhile, Stanford’s Srabanti Chowdhury takes a blanket approach to the heat problem, swaddling transistors in a polycrystalline diamond film. Her team’s technology has progressed remarkably fast, reducing diamond-film growth temperatures from 1,000 °C to less than 400 °C, making it compatible with standard CMOS manufacturing.\nNone of these solutions comes cheap, and so the future of chips is going to be expensive as well as hot. That probably doesn’t faze the big AI companies sitting on giant piles of investors’ cash. As Moore pointed out as he polished off a pickle, “AI’s demand for chips is sort of unlimited, so you’ve got to do things that you wouldn’t have thought of doing before and swallow the expense.”",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/walt-downings-volunteerism",
      "description": "Volunteering is the lifeblood of professional communities, offering individuals the chance to contribute, grow, and collaborate with amazing people. Engaging with the IEEE community has been instrumental in shaping my career since my early days as a student member. Over the years, as I transitioned to a full member and later to a senior member, I witnessed firsthand how volunteering can lead to personal growth and foster meaningful connections in my life and the lives of others.\nI have had the opportunity to work alongside many dedicated volunteers, and a few of them have left a lasting impact on me. One is Walt Downing of San Antonio. An IEEE life senior member, Downing is the executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Southwest Research Institute, which conducts scientific discovery, technology development, independent testing, and analysis for its clients. Based in San Antonio, SwRI works on autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and space exploration, among other projects.\nWalter D. “Walt” Downing\n\nEmployer\nSouthwest Research Institute, in San Antonio\nTitle\nExecutive vice president and chief operating officer \nMember grade\nSenior member\nAlma mater\nSouthern Methodist University, in Dallas\nCollaborating with Walt as an editor and writer for the IEEE Systems Council has been a highlight of my experience with IEEE. I interviewed him for a video I narrated, “IEEE Systems Council: Charting a Course for the Future on its 20th Anniversary.” I’ve watched him in action and admired his unwavering commitment to advancing our field and supporting others.\nAs president of the council from 2022 to 2024 and now chair of the IEEE Lone Star Section, which covers central and southern Texas, Walt embodies the spirit of leadership and collaboration that makes IEEE special. What inspires me to share his story is not just his achievements but also the profound impact he has made on countless members of our community.\nI’ve also worked with him as the chair of the section’s history committee. Despite his busy schedule, he consistently dedicates time to mentor and uplift others, showcasing the true essence of community engagement.\n  Exploring the history of the IEEE Lone Star Section, in Texas, with Walt Downing \n\n\nInspired by the Apollo 11 mission to the moon\nGrowing up in San Antonio, Walt says, he was inspired by technology from an early age. His father, who worked at the Kelly Air Force Base, now Port San Antonio, allowed him to see aircraft up close, sparking his fascination with aviation and aerospace.\nIt was as a senior in high school watching the Apollo 11 mission to the moon in 1969 that truly ignited his passion for engineering, he says. The historic event fueled his dream of contributing to significant technological achievements and solidified his desire to pursue a career in a field that pushed the boundaries of what was possible.\nThose early influences combined to shape his journey, he says, and motivated him to follow a path where he could make a meaningful impact through engineering.\nEarly career success\nWalt’s journey as an engineer began with his involvement in a cooperative education program at Southern Methodist University, in Dallas, where he says he gained valuable experience working part time at Kelly Air Force Base while studying electrical engineering. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in EE in 1973, he accepted a position as an instrumentation and controls engineer in the petrochemical division of Brown & Root, now part of KBR, in Houston. After five years, he returned to San Antonio to work at the SwRI.\nThe nonprofit research organization played a crucial role in shaping his career, he says. It focuses on advanced technology and scientific research for NASA and other government-agency clients.\nThat environment, he says, allowed him to embrace challenges when developing microprocessor-based systems and automated testing technologies.\nRELATED: Reflecting on Leadership: An Interview with Walt Downing\nWithin a few years, he was managing a section specializing in automated test equipment for avionics. He helped expand the work into avionics research and development, ultimately leading to his promotion to vice president. In 1998 he was promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer, a role that enabled him to influence a variety of technical advancements, particularly in automated testing. He worked on early applications of microprocessors for testing systems, including projects for the Minuteman missile and avionics upgrades for legacy aircraft such as the A-10, F-16, and B-52.\nAs COO, his role allows him to set standards for reliability and efficiency in engineering, he says.\nReflecting on his career, Walt identifies pivotal moments that shaped his path, such as his decision to leave Brown & Root for the SwRI.\n“Managing a new section that grew into a division was a critical step in my career,” he says.\nFormer society president\nWalt’s involvement with IEEE began in 1981 through his participation in IEEE AutoTestCon, an annual conference for the aerospace and military automatic test industry. The experience sparked his passion for contributing to the engineering community, he says.\nHe has held a number of IEEE volunteer roles over the years, including serving as president of the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society, where he’d previously served as secretary and vice president of technical operations. During his term as president, he adapted to changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic—which led to new ways of connecting with members.\n“We started delivering our distinguished lecturers program online—which became immensely popular,” he recalls. In the program, experts in their field talk to the society’s chapters about their work.\n“Get connected and stay connected to the professional community. Never stop learning about new technologies.” —Walt Downing\nHe is a past president of the IEEE Systems Council and a member of its administrative committee. He is a member of the IEEE–Eta Kappa Nu honor society as well.\nHe also has served as a program evaluator for ABET, formerly known as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.\n“Active engagement with IEEE maximizes the value of my membership,” he says. “My involvement has expanded my network globally, creating opportunities to build relationships with other professionals and showcase my skills beyond my workplace.”\nInspiring the next generation\nWalt says his motivation for volunteering in the early stages of his career was to advance professionally. Now, however, he says he finds fulfillment in maintaining the connections he’s made within the technical community. His legacy, he hopes, will be one of positively influencing young engineers and technologists to advance their careers.\nHe advises young engineers to get involved with the key conferences in their technical fields of interest.\n“This engagement not only enriches your career but also keeps you connected to the evolving landscape of engineering,” he says.\n“Get connected and stay connected to the professional community,” he suggests. “Never stop learning about new technologies.”\nThat kind of mindset, he says, can help prevent obsolescence while opening doors to new opportunities and technical credentials.\nWalt’s experiences with IEEE illustrate the transformative power of involvement.",

However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental integration of new representations.\n\n[ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nGeneral-purpose robots should possess human-like dexterity and agility to perform tasks with the same versatility as us.

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ford-x-100-concept-car",
      "description": "In 1954, in a moment of absolute frankness, the president of Gifford Motors described his company’s latest luxury automobile: “Designed to appeal to the snob in everyone. Designed to convert your bank account into our dividends.”\nPerhaps you’re wondering why you never heard of such an honest car executive. That’s because he existed only in Hollywood. The lines come from the opening scene of the 1954 drama Woman’s World, in which three businessmen—with a generous assist from their wives—vie to become the next general manager of the fictitious Gifford Motors.\nWhat Was the Ford X-100 Concept Car? \nOnscreen shenanigans aside, the luxury car featured in the film was the real deal: the Ford X-100 concept car. An early version debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in early 1952. The two-door convertible on display had no engine, gears, or gadgets, but its exterior, likely made of plaster and fiberglass, resembled a rocket ship, which was the intention of designer Joe Oros.\n  The Ford X-100’s V-8 engine featured a three-speed automatic transmission.The Henry Ford\nOver the next year and a half, Ford engineers, led by Hiram Pacific, spent at least US $2 million (about $24 million today) turning the display model into a fully functional car. Paul Adams was chief electrical engineer and in charge of most of the gadgets; Paul Wagner was the electrical engineer tasked with making the electrical system work. By the time they were done, the car contained 302 kilograms of electrical equipment, including a 12-volt ignition system, an extra-large generator, 24 electrical motors, 44 vacuum tubes, 50 lightbulbs, 92 control switches, 29 solenoids, 53 relays, 23 circuit breakers, and 10 fuses, all connected by 16 kilometers of wiring. That’s a lot of electronics, but then again, a lot of gizmos were jammed into the car. Touted as a “laboratory on wheels,” the futuristic auto included more than 50 innovations.\nOne of the most visible features was the clear, nonglare, heatproof plastic sliding roof panel. At the flick of a lever, the windows rolled down and the top retracted. When an electrical moisture sensor detected a hint of rain, it would automatically seal the car. Alas, the X-100 did not have air conditioning. I’m a South Carolinian, and the thought of an uncooled drive on a sunny, hot August day is, let’s say, unappealing. I suspect the designers, being in Detroit, hadn’t thought through summer in the Deep South.\n  In this 1953 photo, the Ford X-100’s roof panel is retracted and the windows are down. The Henry Ford\nThe designers did consider certain types of weather because the windshield wipers could spray hot or cold fluid depending on the outside temperature, and the rear window had a defroster. Another feature that I’m sure wowed people in colder climates were the car’s heated leather seats. The front seats were also electrically adjustable in six positions, with presets for two different drivers.\nThe car had a 10-tube, signal-seeking radio with separate controls and speakers for front and rear passengers. The radio itself was tucked out of sight below the dashboard, but a prismatic mirror could be lowered to show the dial.\n  The Ford X-100 had a radiophone [top], built-in electric shaver [middle], and multifunction steering wheel with a clock and variable-volume horn [bottom].The Henry Ford\nBluetooth pairing obviously wasn’t available in 1953, but the Ford X-100 did have a radiophone mounted in the center console, through which you could place calls via the Bell System’s Mobile Telephone Service. It also had a dictaphone to record all those great ideas you’d have while driving around with the wind in your hair. One innovation that didn’t stand the test of time was the electric shaver and pop-up mirror stowed away in the glove compartment.\nEach wheel had a built-in hydraulic jack attached to the chassis to easily lift the car when you had to change a tire. (Tubeless tires weren’t yet commonplace, so changing flats was something every driver had to do.) A clock was mounted in the center of the steering wheel, where you’d expect the horn to be. The horn, meanwhile, could be activated by a thin circle surrounding the clock or from buttons on the arms of the steering wheel. It had two different volume settings, softer for city traffic and louder for country roads.\nThe transmission had an electrically operated gear selector, which most cars didn’t have at the time. In addition to power steering, there was power braking that included an electric power-assisted hand brake. Electric switches on the instrument panel opened, closed, locked, and unlocked the hood and trunk. Unfortunately, though, there were no mechanical releases to open the hood and trunk if the car lost power.\nThe X-100 had a built-in battery charger that could be plugged into an electrical outlet to allow the various gizmos to work even if the car wasn’t running. But not every feature was electrical: Housed in a black leather pouch in front of the center console was a brass pump-style fire extinguisher. Just in case of emergency.\nThe Ford X-100 Was Big in Paris\nThe concept car had its second debut in the summer of 1953 during Ford’s 50th-anniversary celebrations. The anniversary presented a golden opportunity for Henry Ford II to redefine the company, as Douglas Brinkley writes in Wheels for the World, a sweeping history of Ford published by Penguin in 2003 to celebrate the company’s centennial. For its 50th, Ford produced the film The American Road; an illustrated company history, Ford at Fifty: An American Story; a two-hour television special hosted by Edward R. Murrow and featuring Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, and Bing Crosby; and a calendar illustrated by Norman Rockwell.\nAs part of this celebration, the Ford X-100 made the European circuit of auto shows. It racked up nearly 10,000 km crisscrossing the continent, driving from Paris to London to Bonn to Cologne and averaging 12 miles per gallon (about 5 km per liter) of gasoline. Despite its gas gauge indicator lights, the X-100 ran out of gas in the middle of the night on its final trip to the French port of Le Havre.\n  The Ford X-100, shown here in Paris, racked up nearly 30,000 kilometers driving to auto shows, fairs, and dealerships. Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images\nThe car also toured the United States, stopping at fairs and dealerships and adding another 12,000 miles (19,300 km) to the odometer. A Ford engineer always accompanied the car to demonstrate the various features and answer any questions.\nThe X-100 wasn’t exactly the star of Woman’s World, but the movie industry estimated that 80 million people saw its features demonstrated on screen. Four other Ford concept cars also appeared, including the XL-500, the XM-800, and the Ventura, as did a Detroit auto plant.\nBetween the movie and the auto shows, Ford estimated that more people saw the X-100 than any other concept car. The company eventually donated the X-100 to The Henry Ford museum, in Dearborn, Mich., where it went into storage. In 1987, the X-100 went back on public display as part of the Automobile in American Life exhibit. Although the car isn’t currently on exhibit, it still turns up occasionally at auto shows.\nRELATED: Concept-Car Tech Makes Wheels Wise to Well-being\nThe purpose of a concept car is to excite the public with dreams of a possible future. The Ford X-100 did more than that: It not only embodied aspiration and hope, it actually delivered on many of its promises. Car-connected phones, heated seats, and electric windows may seem commonplace now, but they first had to be imagined. With the exception of that electric shaver, kudos to the Ford engineers of the 1950s for making those dreams a reality.\nPart of a continuing series looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.\nAn abridged version of this article appears in the November 2025 print issue as “Ford and the Road Mostly Taken.”\nReferences\n\nI love when I get to watch old movies as part of my research, and Woman’s World was fun. The men vying to lead the fictitious Gifford Motors are played by Cornel Wilde, Fred MacMurray, and Van Heflin, while the women behind the men are played by June Allyson, Lauren Bacall, and Arlene Dahl.\nThe X-100 is demonstrated in the opening scenes, and tours of the Detroit automobile factory are in the first half before the action shifts to a dinner party.\nCurators at The Henry Ford provided me with press releases about the X-100—including one in French—as well as oral histories of the designers Joseph Oros and John Najjar.\nJim and Cheryl Farrell’s 1999 book Ford Design Department Concept & Show Cars 1932–1961 has the best description of the X-100. Douglas Brinkley’s Wheels for the World (Penguin, 2003) gives a detailed history of a century at Ford.",

      "description": "Diamonds, lasers, and oil aren’t the first things you may think of when considering ways to keep chips and computers cool. But as modern chip designs pack and stack more transistors into ever smaller spaces, heat has emerged as a critical problem. \nTo solve it, the semiconductor industry is throwing everything at the wall. What sticks could enable the scaling of not only AI data centers but also a host of applications in consumer electronics, communications, and military equipment. \n“As we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse,” said  Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, who has been covering semiconductors on and off for a quarter century. \nFor the special report in this issue, Moore teamed up with Associate Editor Dina Genkina, who oversees our computing coverage. They talked to engineers at IEEE conferences like IEDM and Supercomputing about how technologists are getting the heat out in new and surprising ways. \nSee the full report: https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/keeping-chips-cool/",
