        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/645217/best-apple-airpods-pro",
        "description": "Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes only work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.\nThere are currently four AirPods models to choose from, each with its own distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of over-ear headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple offers three options: the AirPods Pro 3, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4.\nHow we test AirPods\nWe spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we test the active noise cancellation across a wide range of environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.\nThe best AirPods overall\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam and silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro are better than their predecessor in numerous ways, starting with the fit. Apple’s latest flagship earbuds feature a more angular design and a wider range of ear tip sizes — including an XXS option. Their “foam-infused” tips combine foam and silicone, so they expand slightly for better comfort and a tighter seal. If you’ve ever cursed at AirPods for falling out of your ears, the Pro 3’s improved fit alone might sell you.\nThey also deliver upgrades to noise cancellation, which allow them to rival even the AirPods Max. They’re noticeably better at dampening high-frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro, and they can eliminate the low hum of an airplane engine. Sound quality has also been improved in ways that were surprisingly easy to pick out: bass is punchier, vocals are clearer, and you’ll notice new layers in your favorite tracks. Meanwhile, battery life will last you a full work day with ANC enabled before the buds need to go back into the charging case for a refill.\nIn addition to giving users the flexibility to use these earbuds as clinical-grade hearing aids — a feature introduced last year — Apple has added a heart rate sensor to this model, allowing you to track workouts right from your ears. Add in IP57 water and dust resistance, stronger Find My capabilities, and a live translation feature, and it’s clear the AirPods Pro are Apple’s best wireless earbuds by a wide margin.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best AirPods for those who find ear tips uncomfortable\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: No / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nNot everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation in the AirPods Pro 3, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never totally cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need it.\nApple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same good sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. The more expensive pair has features that you might want, including active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case (it supports Find My and wireless charging). You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC, since these don’t use a sealed ear tip.\nIf you’re truly interested in noise-canceling earbuds, consider upgrading to the AirPods Pro 3. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience overall. I’d only steer you to the noise-canceling AirPods 4 if you’re really opposed to ear tips.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\n\n\nScore: 8.5\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHigh-luxury design\nTerrific, balanced sound quality\nVery effective noise cancellation\nDependable and foolproof controls\nSpatial audio for immersive entertainment\n\nHeavier than many competitors\nNo 3.5mm jack\nWired listening requires $35 cable\nCase is an abomination\nLacks latest AirPods Pro features\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $495.81 at Amazon\n $549.99 $499.99 at Best Buy\n $549 $529 at B&H Photo\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 20 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: No / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nWe’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at a high cost. Not just that, these headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and probably won’t leave you with sweaty ears. \nThe AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones.\nYou lose some features found in the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC — including conversation awareness and adaptive audio — because the AirPods Max use Apple’s older H1 chip. However, the company added lossless audio over USB-C in April, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity in Apple’s entire lineup. \nRead my full AirPods Max (Lightning) review.\nWhat’s coming next\nWith Apple’s fall hardware event in the rearview mirror, we’re at a point where the company’s lineup seems settled (for now). Apple doesn’t upgrade its entry-level AirPods line on an annual basis like some of its other products, and the Pro 3 just hit the market. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have gone relatively unchanged since their release in 2020, with Apple adding a USB-C model and new color options last year. It’s possible that we’ll see a camera-equipped pair of AirPods with support for Apple Intelligence in the future — a report from last year indicated as much — but it’s not likely to be anytime soon.\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted to reflect current pricing / availability and new related links.",

        "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with most original Switch games, which is a great feature to tide early adopters (like me!) over until more Switch 2 exclusives launch. The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on Amazon, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.\nSamsung P9 microSD Express Card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $99.99 $94.99 at Amazon (512GB, with on-page coupon)\n\nThe current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is a card from Onn, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.\nAs for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment requires 43.4GB of space, while Silksong only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade requires a 93GB download.\nEven physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.",

        "description": "GTA 6 artwork | Image: Rockstar Games\t\n\nIt’s been over a decade and two console generations since GTA V came out, and its sequel is still a work in progress. GTA VI has faced multiple delays, with developer Rockstar Games bumping back its predicted release date twice, first to May 26th, 2026, then again to November 19th, 2026, a full year after its originally planned release window of fall 2025. \nDespite the delays, we have gotten some early glimpses of GTA VI. Its most recent trailer offers a look at the game’s protagonists, Jason and Lucia. The main story will follow the pair around Vice City as they attempt to navigate a criminal conspiracy after a job goes south.  \nGTA VI has had a rocky road to release so far, with leaks early on and more recently, developer Rockstar facing accusations of union busting after firing more than 30 employees just days before announcing GTA VI’s most recent delay.\nRead on below for all of the news and updates about Grand Theft Auto VI.\nGrand Theft Auto VI launch delayed until November 2026\n\t\t\t\nRockstar claims fired employees were leaking company information.\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI developer accused of union busting in mass firings\n\t\t\t\nAm I the only person that didn’t watch the GTA VI trailer?\n\t\t\t\nRockstar says new GTA VI trailer was ‘equal parts gameplay and cutscenes’\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI’s second trailer sets up its Bonnie and Clyde story\n\t\t\t\nLet’s rewatch the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI release delayed to May 2026\n\t\t\t\nGTA V is Twitch’s most watched game of 2024\n\t\t\t\nGTA V is coming back to Game Pass, again.\n\t\t\t\nRockstar’s working on bringing Roblox creators to GTA VI\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI is still coming this fall.\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025\n\t\t\t\nIt’s RTO for the GTA VI devs.\n\t\t\t\nGTA Online will no longer support Rockstar Editor on old-gen consoles.\n\t\t\t\nY’all really liked that trailer, huh?\n\t\t\t\nDigital Foundry posted a nearly 37-minute analysis of the GTA VI trailer.\n\t\t\t\nThe GTA VI trailer is already breaking viewership records on YouTube.\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI isn’t launching on PC.\n\t\t\t\nThe first GTA VI trailer is here\n\t\t\t\nThis is where you can watch the first GTA VI trailer tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\nSpeak softly, then drop a hype-ass trailer.\n\t\t\t\nGrand Theft Auto VI’s first trailer will debut in December\n\t\t\t\nRockstar confirms hack, says work on GTA VI will ‘continue as planned’\n\t\t\t\nGTA 6 gameplay leaks online in 90 videos\n\t\t\t\nGTA VI could finally let you blow up Miami as a woman in 2024\n\t\t\t\nRockstar finally confirms it’s working on the next Grand Theft Auto",

        "description": "Robot vacuums that can both mop and sweep your floors have improved significantly in recent years. While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor-sweeping bots.\nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nBest robot vacuum and mop\nDeebot X8 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-cleaning roller mop\nExtendable mop\nExcellent obstacle avoidance\nSmaller dock\n\nLimited mop lift\nHeavy, struggles with transitions\nSingle roller brush\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $839.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $1099.99 at Ecovacs\n $1099.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter \nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1,599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $499.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. It can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $649.99 at Dreame (with code BFX40UA)\n $1199.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $1199.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nEufy Omni S1 Pro\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong roller mop\nSleek, futuristic design\nDual side brushes\nSquare shape helps with corners\n\nMiddling vacuum performance\nNo self-cleaning base\nNo mop extension\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $594.99 at Eufy (with code WSLDV2LXEBGE)\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Amazon\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nNarwal Freo Z Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSuperb mopping\nGreat obstacle avoidance\nExcellent dirt detection\nSelf-cleans its washboard\nVery quiet\n\nMinimal mop lift\nEdge cleaning just okay\nUses a lot of water\nApp is unreliable\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n $1499.99 $947.99 at Amazon (at checkout)\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Narwal (with code BFPREFRZU)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nSwitchBot S10\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAlmost hands-free\nExcellent roller mop\nSelf-cleans\nBattery-powered water station\nSupports Matter\n\nBig and wide\nCan’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum\nShort battery life\nLow suction power\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $456 at Switchbot (with code BXBX58)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently released the Switchbot S20 ($480 $799.99), which looks like the Pro model that made its debut at CES. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($949.99, 1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999.99 $2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vacuum occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent model with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads that it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($949.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($799.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($849.99 $999.99) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\niRobot also recently introduced an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705, the Roomba Max 705 Combo, which is available for $1,299.99. Like the Max 705, it features dual rubber roller brushes that are resistant to tangling, along with AI-powered obstacle detection. It also comes with a unique roller mop cover that automatically deploys as it cleans, as well as a design that allows the mop to extend into corners and clean along wall edges.\nPriced at $750 (with code WS24T2352111), Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe recently launched Narwal Flow costs $1,299.99 with code NFLOW $1,499.99, and features the company’s first roller mop, which can also extend. We haven’t spent any time with it yet, but Narwal claims it can easily tackle thick, fluffy carpets thanks to its deep carpet boost mode.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. This is easily one of the smartest cleaners I’ve tried, with great mapping and cleaning performance that feels surprisingly close to what a person would typically achieve. It’s also simple to run, easy to maintain, and reliable. We’ll have a full review soon, but for now, here’s some video of it in action.\nThe $1,099.99 Eureka J20 features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction, but it is no longer available on Eureka’s website. The new J15 Max Ultra ($1,199) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,049.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 ($480 with code FLFL44, $799.99), which resembles the Pro model announced at CES earlier this year, is now available. It’s essentially the successor to our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum, the Switchbot S10, with an extendable roller mop / side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags, either.\nThe $299.99 $549.99 Roborock Q10 S5 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop delivers 10,000Pa of suction power and uses a sonic mop that scrubs floors 3,000 times per minute. It also comes with a 2.7-liter self-emptying base that can hold up to 70 days’ worth of debris, along with room-specific cleaning, no-go zones, and customizable cleaning schedules.\nThe $1,199.99 $1,599.99 Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete features a roller-style mopping system that continuously cleans itself in real time. Its companion model, the Aqua10 Ultra Track Complete, adds hot-water mopping and automatically adds cleaning solution as it moves about, so you don’t have to stop and refill anything.\nThe $1,799.99 $1,999.99 Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra comes with a multi-mop switching dock, one that lets it automatically swap between nylon scrub pads, sponge pads, and thermal mop pads based on where it’s cleaning. Its three-solution compartment also holds separate cleaners aimed at tackling pet odors, wood floors, and general messes, which the robovac will dispense on its own depending on the situation.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed the Roborock S8 Plus, and added info regarding the Roborock Q10 S5 Plus, the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete, and the Dreame Matrix10 Ultra.

        "title": "Tesla shareholders approve Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package",
        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/815892/tesla-shareholder-vote-elon-musk-pay-trillion-robot",
        "description": "Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk’s staggering new pay package, in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO’s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. \nThe vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days.\nMusk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of “Elon! Elon!” and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” he said. \nThe proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September, would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. \nIn the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating — and controlling — a “robot army.”\n\nMusk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years.\n\n\nThe vote was opposed by some of Tesla’s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. \nMusk’s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla’s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld her ruling blocking it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling spurred Musk to engineer a proposal to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, which shareholders also approved. \nThe new award comes as the board continues to push the message that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm. In reality, Tesla’s position is shakier than ever. Musk’s support for President Donald Trump and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and cancel humanitarian aid programs spawned a nationwide protest movement and a steep drop in sales. The expiration of the federal EV tax credit is expected to lead to an even further drop in sales. \nWhether Musk can achieve these audacious goals set out in the pay package seems increasingly at odds with his approach to the technology. Tesla rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The cars still all feature safety monitors, either in the driver or passenger seat — though Musk has said they could be removed by the end of the year. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a consumer flop. And competition from other automakers, especially those in China, has been shrinking Tesla’s market share and sapping its resources.",

        "description": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple (128GB)\n $599.99 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $599.99 at Verizon (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the newer iPhone Air. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming, and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead our full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best cheap Android phone\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Google (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $550.85 at Amazon\n $599.99 $549.99 at OnePlus (with code EARLYBF)\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead our full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice available in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nThe Nothing Phone 3A and 3A Pro are currently available in beta for $379 and $459, respectively. The 3A and 3A Pro are mainly differentiated by their cameras. Both phones feature a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide; however, the 3A Pro’s prominent round camera housing includes a 3x periscope telephoto lens, while the 3A offers a standard 2x zoom. They also offer improved hardware over the Phone 2A and a new feature called the Essential Space, which allows you to store and index your miscellaneous screenshots, voice memos, and photographs through a dedicated button.\nWhat’s coming next\nMotorola is planning to release two additional devices before the end of the year. The $169 Moto G Play (2026) is set to release on November 13th, while the $199 Moto G (2026) is slated for December 11th. Both devices pack a 5,200mAh battery, an IP52 rating for water and dust resistance, a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The devices also launch with Android 16, with support for features like Google Gemini and Circle to Search. The main difference between the two is that the Moto G features a 50-megapixel camera, whereas the G Play has a 32-megapixel shooter.\nThe OnePlus 15 is set to launch in the US on November 13th, although its exact price remains unknown. However, we do know what the device will offer when it becomes available, including a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, a huge 7,300mAh battery, and a speedy 165Hz refresh rate display. It also features a triple 50-megapixel camera setup, along with a more durable IP68 and IP69K rating for enduring high-pressure water jets.\nNow that Google’s flagship Pixel 10 lineup has been released, we’re starting to see early murmurs regarding the Pixel 10A. So far, not much is known about the device, though some leaked CAD renders suggest it will be a spitting image of the excellent Pixel 9A. If history is anything to go by, the entry-level 10A will borrow some key features from the 10, meaning it’s possible we’ll see the more affordable handset launch with Google’s latest Tensor G5 processor.\nUpdate, November 6th: Updated pricing / availability and added info about the Moto G Play (2026), the Moto G (2026), the OnePlus 15, and the Google Pixel 10A.

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/815806/senate-resolution-trump-us-ai-technology-china",
        "description": "A group of senators is urging President Donald Trump to preserve the US’s edge in AI development by denying China access to its most advanced chips and models. The bipartisan resolution, submitted by Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), comes just days after Trump walked back a statement that suggested he would consider allowing Nvidia to sell its powerful Blackwell chip in China. \nThe resolution, which is cosponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Dave McCormick (R-PA), brings attention to China’s “efforts to close the AI gap and leap ahead” of the US when it comes to developing and deploying frontier AI models. It adds that China’s “inability to make and access computing power is the main impediment to its progress.” To keep the US in the lead, the senators call on the government to urge US companies to continue offering “priority access” to its most advanced AI chips, cloud infrastructure, and models to allies, while preventing China and other adversaries from obtaining the technology.\n“We cannot allow China to leap ahead of us and bolster their weapons capabilities, maximize their cyberattacks against American industry, and threaten long-term U.S. economic and national security,” Senator Coons says in a statement. “This bipartisan resolution sets us on a path toward a different future — one in which frontier AI systems are built in the United States by American companies.”\nThe Senators want the government to continue enforcing export controls that prevent US chipmakers like Nvidia from selling their most advanced chips to China, a policy put at risk last month when Trump said he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping about selling Nvidia’s Blackwell chip in the country.\nIn an interview with The Financial Times this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that “China is going to win the AI race,” citing lower energy costs and fewer regulations. He later followed up with an additional statement, saying China is just “nanoseconds behind America in AI.” Earlier this year, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shivers through the industry with the launch of cost-efficient AI models that perform similarly to data-hungry rivals from companies like OpenAI.\nTrump has since struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD that will require the companies to pay the government a 15 percent commission on the stripped-down chips they sell to China.",

        "title": "The best AirPods to buy",
        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/645217/best-apple-airpods-pro",
        "description": "Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes only work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.\nThere are currently four AirPods models to choose from, each with its own distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of over-ear headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple offers three options: the AirPods Pro 3, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4.\nHow we test AirPods\nWe spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we test the active noise cancellation across a wide range of environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.\nThe best AirPods overall\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam and silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro are better than their predecessor in numerous ways, starting with the fit. Apple’s latest flagship earbuds feature a more angular design and a wider range of ear tip sizes — including an XXS option. Their “foam-infused” tips combine foam and silicone, so they expand slightly for better comfort and a tighter seal. If you’ve ever cursed at AirPods for falling out of your ears, the Pro 3’s improved fit alone might sell you.\nThey also deliver upgrades to noise cancellation, which allow them to rival even the AirPods Max. They’re noticeably better at dampening high-frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro, and they can eliminate the low hum of an airplane engine. Sound quality has also been improved in ways that were surprisingly easy to pick out: bass is punchier, vocals are clearer, and you’ll notice new layers in your favorite tracks. Meanwhile, battery life will last you a full work day with ANC enabled before the buds need to go back into the charging case for a refill.\nIn addition to giving users the flexibility to use these earbuds as clinical-grade hearing aids — a feature introduced last year — Apple has added a heart rate sensor to this model, allowing you to track workouts right from your ears. Add in IP57 water and dust resistance, stronger Find My capabilities, and a live translation feature, and it’s clear the AirPods Pro are Apple’s best wireless earbuds by a wide margin.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best AirPods for those who find ear tips uncomfortable\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: No / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nNot everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation in the AirPods Pro 3, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never totally cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need it.\nApple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same good sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. The more expensive pair has features that you might want, including active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case (it supports Find My and wireless charging). You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC, since these don’t use a sealed ear tip.\nIf you’re truly interested in noise-canceling earbuds, consider upgrading to the AirPods Pro 3. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience overall. I’d only steer you to the noise-canceling AirPods 4 if you’re really opposed to ear tips.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\n\n\nScore: 8.5\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHigh-luxury design\nTerrific, balanced sound quality\nVery effective noise cancellation\nDependable and foolproof controls\nSpatial audio for immersive entertainment\n\nHeavier than many competitors\nNo 3.5mm jack\nWired listening requires $35 cable\nCase is an abomination\nLacks latest AirPods Pro features\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $495.81 at Amazon\n $549.99 $499.99 at Best Buy\n $549 $529 at B&H Photo\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 20 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: No / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS\nWe’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at a high cost. Not just that, these headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and probably won’t leave you with sweaty ears. \nThe AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones.\nYou lose some features found in the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC — including conversation awareness and adaptive audio — because the AirPods Max use Apple’s older H1 chip. However, the company added lossless audio over USB-C in April, meaning these headphones offer the richest audio fidelity in Apple’s entire lineup. \nRead my full AirPods Max (Lightning) review.\nWhat’s coming next\nWith Apple’s fall hardware event in the rearview mirror, we’re at a point where the company’s lineup seems settled (for now). Apple doesn’t upgrade its entry-level AirPods line on an annual basis like some of its other products, and the Pro 3 just hit the market. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have gone relatively unchanged since their release in 2020, with Apple adding a USB-C model and new color options last year. It’s possible that we’ll see a camera-equipped pair of AirPods with support for Apple Intelligence in the future — a report from last year indicated as much — but it’s not likely to be anytime soon.\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted to reflect current pricing / availability and new related links.",

        "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with most original Switch games, which is a great feature to tide early adopters (like me!) over until more Switch 2 exclusives launch. The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on Amazon, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.\nSamsung P9 microSD Express Card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $99.99 $94.99 at Amazon (512GB, with on-page coupon)\n\nThe current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is a card from Onn, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.\nAs for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment requires 43.4GB of space, while Silksong only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade requires a 93GB download.\nEven physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.",

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/tech/625409/best-robot-vacuum-mops",
        "description": "Robot vacuums that can both mop and sweep your floors have improved significantly in recent years. While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor-sweeping bots.\nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nBest robot vacuum and mop\nDeebot X8 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-cleaning roller mop\nExtendable mop\nExcellent obstacle avoidance\nSmaller dock\n\nLimited mop lift\nHeavy, struggles with transitions\nSingle roller brush\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $839.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $1099.99 at Ecovacs\n $1099.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter \nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1,599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $499.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. It can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $649.99 at Dreame (with code BFX40UA)\n $1199.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $1199.99 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nEufy Omni S1 Pro\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong roller mop\nSleek, futuristic design\nDual side brushes\nSquare shape helps with corners\n\nMiddling vacuum performance\nNo self-cleaning base\nNo mop extension\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $594.99 at Eufy (with code WSLDV2LXEBGE)\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Amazon\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nNarwal Freo Z Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSuperb mopping\nGreat obstacle avoidance\nExcellent dirt detection\nSelf-cleans its washboard\nVery quiet\n\nMinimal mop lift\nEdge cleaning just okay\nUses a lot of water\nApp is unreliable\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n $1499.99 $947.99 at Amazon (at checkout)\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Narwal (with code BFPREFRZU)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nSwitchBot S10\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAlmost hands-free\nExcellent roller mop\nSelf-cleans\nBattery-powered water station\nSupports Matter\n\nBig and wide\nCan’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum\nShort battery life\nLow suction power\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $456 at Switchbot (with code BXBX58)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience.

These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently released the Switchbot S20 ($480 $799.99), which looks like the Pro model that made its debut at CES. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($949.99, 1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999.99 $2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vacuum occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent model with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads that it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($949.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($799.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($849.99 $999.99) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\niRobot also recently introduced an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705, the Roomba Max 705 Combo, which is available for $1,299.99. Like the Max 705, it features dual rubber roller brushes that are resistant to tangling, along with AI-powered obstacle detection. It also comes with a unique roller mop cover that automatically deploys as it cleans, as well as a design that allows the mop to extend into corners and clean along wall edges.\nPriced at $750 (with code WS24T2352111), Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe recently launched Narwal Flow costs $1,299.99 with code NFLOW $1,499.99, and features the company’s first roller mop, which can also extend. We haven’t spent any time with it yet, but Narwal claims it can easily tackle thick, fluffy carpets thanks to its deep carpet boost mode.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. This is easily one of the smartest cleaners I’ve tried, with great mapping and cleaning performance that feels surprisingly close to what a person would typically achieve. It’s also simple to run, easy to maintain, and reliable. We’ll have a full review soon, but for now, here’s some video of it in action.\nThe $1,099.99 Eureka J20 features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction, but it is no longer available on Eureka’s website. The new J15 Max Ultra ($1,199) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,049.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 ($480 with code FLFL44, $799.99), which resembles the Pro model announced at CES earlier this year, is now available. It’s essentially the successor to our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum, the Switchbot S10, with an extendable roller mop / side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags, either.\nThe $299.99 $549.99 Roborock Q10 S5 Plus Robot Vacuum and Mop delivers 10,000Pa of suction power and uses a sonic mop that scrubs floors 3,000 times per minute. It also comes with a 2.7-liter self-emptying base that can hold up to 70 days’ worth of debris, along with room-specific cleaning, no-go zones, and customizable cleaning schedules.\nThe $1,199.99 $1,599.99 Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete features a roller-style mopping system that continuously cleans itself in real time. Its companion model, the Aqua10 Ultra Track Complete, adds hot-water mopping and automatically adds cleaning solution as it moves about, so you don’t have to stop and refill anything.\nThe $1,799.99 $1,999.99 Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra comes with a multi-mop switching dock, one that lets it automatically swap between nylon scrub pads, sponge pads, and thermal mop pads based on where it’s cleaning. Its three-solution compartment also holds separate cleaners aimed at tackling pet odors, wood floors, and general messes, which the robovac will dispense on its own depending on the situation.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, November 6th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed the Roborock S8 Plus, and added info regarding the Roborock Q10 S5 Plus, the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller Complete, and the Dreame Matrix10 Ultra.

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/815892/tesla-shareholder-vote-elon-musk-pay-trillion-robot",
        "description": "Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk’s staggering new pay package, in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO’s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. \nThe vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days.\nMusk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of “Elon! Elon!” and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” he said. \nThe proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September, would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. \nIn the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating — and controlling — a “robot army.”\n\nMusk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years.\n\n\nThe vote was opposed by some of Tesla’s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. \nMusk’s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla’s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld her ruling blocking it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling spurred Musk to engineer a proposal to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, which shareholders also approved. \nThe new award comes as the board continues to push the message that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm. In reality, Tesla’s position is shakier than ever. Musk’s support for President Donald Trump and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and cancel humanitarian aid programs spawned a nationwide protest movement and a steep drop in sales. The expiration of the federal EV tax credit is expected to lead to an even further drop in sales. \nWhether Musk can achieve these audacious goals set out in the pay package seems increasingly at odds with his approach to the technology. Tesla rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The cars still all feature safety monitors, either in the driver or passenger seat — though Musk has said they could be removed by the end of the year. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a consumer flop. And competition from other automakers, especially those in China, has been shrinking Tesla’s market share and sapping its resources.",

        "description": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple (128GB)\n $599.99 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $599.99 at Verizon (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the newer iPhone Air. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming, and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead our full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best cheap Android phone\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Best Buy (128GB)\n $499 $399 at Google (128GB)\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $550.85 at Amazon\n $599.99 $549.99 at OnePlus (with code EARLYBF)\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead our full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice available in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nThe Nothing Phone 3A and 3A Pro are currently available in beta for $379 and $459, respectively. The 3A and 3A Pro are mainly differentiated by their cameras. Both phones feature a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide; however, the 3A Pro’s prominent round camera housing includes a 3x periscope telephoto lens, while the 3A offers a standard 2x zoom. They also offer improved hardware over the Phone 2A and a new feature called the Essential Space, which allows you to store and index your miscellaneous screenshots, voice memos, and photographs through a dedicated button.\nWhat’s coming next\nMotorola is planning to release two additional devices before the end of the year. The $169 Moto G Play (2026) is set to release on November 13th, while the $199 Moto G (2026) is slated for December 11th. Both devices pack a 5,200mAh battery, an IP52 rating for water and dust resistance, a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The devices also launch with Android 16, with support for features like Google Gemini and Circle to Search. The main difference between the two is that the Moto G features a 50-megapixel camera, whereas the G Play has a 32-megapixel shooter.\nThe OnePlus 15 is set to launch in the US on November 13th, although its exact price remains unknown. However, we do know what the device will offer when it becomes available, including a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, a huge 7,300mAh battery, and a speedy 165Hz refresh rate display. It also features a triple 50-megapixel camera setup, along with a more durable IP68 and IP69K rating for enduring high-pressure water jets.\nNow that Google’s flagship Pixel 10 lineup has been released, we’re starting to see early murmurs regarding the Pixel 10A. So far, not much is known about the device, though some leaked CAD renders suggest it will be a spitting image of the excellent Pixel 9A. If history is anything to go by, the entry-level 10A will borrow some key features from the 10, meaning it’s possible we’ll see the more affordable handset launch with Google’s latest Tensor G5 processor.\nUpdate, November 6th: Updated pricing / availability and added info about the Moto G Play (2026), the Moto G (2026), the OnePlus 15, and the Google Pixel 10A.

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/news/815806/senate-resolution-trump-us-ai-technology-china",
        "description": "A group of senators is urging President Donald Trump to preserve the US’s edge in AI development by denying China access to its most advanced chips and models. The bipartisan resolution, submitted by Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), comes just days after Trump walked back a statement that suggested he would consider allowing Nvidia to sell its powerful Blackwell chip in China. \nThe resolution, which is cosponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Dave McCormick (R-PA), brings attention to China’s “efforts to close the AI gap and leap ahead” of the US when it comes to developing and deploying frontier AI models. It adds that China’s “inability to make and access computing power is the main impediment to its progress.” To keep the US in the lead, the senators call on the government to urge US companies to continue offering “priority access” to its most advanced AI chips, cloud infrastructure, and models to allies, while preventing China and other adversaries from obtaining the technology.\n“We cannot allow China to leap ahead of us and bolster their weapons capabilities, maximize their cyberattacks against American industry, and threaten long-term U.S. economic and national security,” Senator Coons says in a statement. “This bipartisan resolution sets us on a path toward a different future — one in which frontier AI systems are built in the United States by American companies.”\nThe Senators want the government to continue enforcing export controls that prevent US chipmakers like Nvidia from selling their most advanced chips to China, a policy put at risk last month when Trump said he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping about selling Nvidia’s Blackwell chip in the country.\nIn an interview with The Financial Times this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that “China is going to win the AI race,” citing lower energy costs and fewer regulations. He later followed up with an additional statement, saying China is just “nanoseconds behind America in AI.” Earlier this year, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shivers through the industry with the launch of cost-efficient AI models that perform similarly to data-hungry rivals from companies like OpenAI.\nTrump has since struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD that will require the companies to pay the government a 15 percent commission on the stripped-down chips they sell to China.",
