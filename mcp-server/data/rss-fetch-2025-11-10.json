      "description": "This is a submission for the Agentic Postgres Challenge with Tiger Data\nCode Cleanup Agents - A production-ready code analysis system that uses Tiger Data's zero-copy database forks to enable true multi-agent architecture. Four specialized AI agents work in parallel across isolated database forks, analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, quality issues, performance problems, and best practice violations.\nModern codebases are complex, and AI-generated code is everywhere. Developers need comprehensive analysis that goes beyond simple linting - they need security scanning, performance optimization, quality checks, and best practices enforcement. Traditional tools run sequentially or require complex infrastructure to parallelize.\nBy leveraging Tiger Data's fast, zero-copy database forks, I built a system where each AI agent gets its own isolated database workspace. They analyze code simultaneously without interference, then merge their findings into the main database.\nLive Demo: https://code-cleanup-agents.onrender.com\nRepository: https://github.com/LuminArk-AI/code-cleanup-agents.git\n✅ 4 Specialized AI Agents working in parallel\n🔒 Security Agent: Detects SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, dangerous functions\n✨ Quality Agent: Finds code smells, duplicates, missing documentation\n⚡ Performance Agent: Identifies N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient patterns\n📋 Best Practices Agent: Enforces language idioms, naming conventions, coding standards\n✅ Real-time Analysis - Upload code, get comprehensive results in seconds\n✅ Semantic Code Search - Find code patterns using natural language queries\n✅ Beautiful Web Interface - Clean, intuitive UI with live feedback\n✅ Production-Ready - Deployed, tested, and battle-proven on real codebases\n┌─────────────────┐\n│  Code Upload    │\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n    ┌────▼─────┐\n    │Coordinator│\n    │ (Main DB) │\n    └─┬──┬──┬──┬┘\n      │  │  │  │\n   ┌──▼┐┌▼─┐┌▼─┐┌▼─────────────┐\n   │ 🔒││✨││⚡││📋            │\n   │Sec││Qua││Per││BestPractices│\n   │For││For││For││   (Main)    │\n   │k 1││k 2││k 3││             │\n   └──┬┘└┬─┘└┬─┘└┬─────────────┘\n      │  │  │  │\n      └──┴──┴──┴──► Merge Results\n                      │\n                 ┌────▼────┐\n                 │ Display │\n                 └─────────┘\n\n1.

Real-World Results\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MA4PBol\nFinding actual issues in production code - 15 improvements identified\n\n\n  \n  \n  How I Used Agentic Postgres\n\n\n  \n  \n  1. Fast, Zero-Copy Forks - The Foundation\n\n\nThis is the killer feature. Each agent gets its own database fork created instantly:\n# Agent isolation via forks\nsecurity_engine = create_engine(SECURITY_FORK_URL)\nquality_engine = create_engine(QUALITY_FORK_URL)\nperformance_engine = create_engine(PERFORMANCE_FORK_URL)\n\n# Parallel execution\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n    security_future = executor.submit(analyze_security, security_engine, code)\n    quality_future = executor.submit(analyze_quality, quality_engine, code)\n    performance_future = executor.submit(analyze_performance, performance_engine, code)\n\nWhy this matters: Traditional approaches would require complex locking, transactions, or separate database instances. With Tiger's zero-copy forks, agents can't interfere with each other's work, and we get true parallel processing for free.\nProof it works: Tiger monitoring shows simultaneous activity spikes across all three forks during analysis:\n\npg_text Search for Semantic Code Discovery\n\n\nImplemented fuzzy text matching using PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension:\nCREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;\n\nCREATE INDEX code_content_trgm_idx \nON code_submissions \nUSING gin (code_content gin_trgm_ops);\n\n-- Semantic search query\nSELECT filename, code_content,\n       similarity(code_content, 'authentication logic') as score\nFROM code_submissions\nWHERE similarity(code_content, 'authentication logic') > 0.2\nORDER BY score DESC;\n\nThis enables natural language queries like:\n\"Show me all database connection code\"\n\"Find authentication logic\"\n\"Where do we handle passwords?\"\nThe similarity scores guide developers to relevant code even when exact keywords don't match.\nHybrid Search Combining Multiple Methods\n\n\nThe system combines:\nTrigram similarity for fuzzy text matching\nMetadata filtering for structured searches\n\n\nRegex patterns for precise code pattern matching\n\n\n\n\ndef hybrid_search(query):\n    # Semantic search via pg_trgm\n    semantic_results = search_by_similarity(query)\n\n    # Pattern matching\n    pattern_results = search_by_regex(query)\n\n    # Combine and rank results\n    return merge_and_rank(semantic_results, pattern_results)\n\nIntelligent Resource Allocation\n\n\nI didn't just fork everything blindly. The architecture demonstrates understanding of when to use forks:\nCritical analyses in isolated forks:\nSecurity scanning (Fork 1) - Needs isolation for sensitive data\nQuality analysis (Fork 2) - Heavy processing, many writes\nPerformance checking (Fork 3) - Complex queries on code structure\nLightweight checks on main DB:\nBest Practices agent - Simple pattern matching, low overhead\nThis shows that forks are a tool for specific use cases, not a hammer for every nail.\nReal-time Collaborative Analysis\n\n\nUsing PostgreSQL's connection pooling with asyncpg, the system supports concurrent writes from multiple agents. Each agent stores findings independently, then the coordinator merges results:\ndef merge_findings(submission_id):\n    \"\"\"Merge agent findings from forks to main database\"\"\"\n    with main_db.connect() as conn:\n        # Gather from all forks\n        security_findings = get_from_fork(security_fork, submission_id)\n        quality_findings = get_from_fork(quality_fork, submission_id)\n\n        # Merge into main\n        for finding in security_findings + quality_findings:\n            conn.execute(insert_merged_finding(finding))\n\nThis demonstrates Tiger's Fluid Storage - data flows seamlessly between forks and the main database.\nTiger MCP Ready Architecture\n\n\nWhile I focused on the core functionality first, the system is architected for Tiger MCP integration. Each agent is structured as an independent service that communicates through the database:\nclass Agent:\n    def __init__(self, fork_engine, agent_type):\n        self.db = fork_engine\n        self.type = agent_type\n\n    def analyze(self, code, submission_id):\n        \"\"\"Agent operates independently in its fork\"\"\"\n        issues = self._scan(code)\n        self._save_to_fork(issues, submission_id)\n        return issues\n\nThis agent pattern is perfect for MCP-based orchestration in future iterations.\n1. Zero-Copy Forks Are a Game Changer\nComing from traditional databases, the instant fork creation was mind-blowing. No copying data, no waiting, no complex setup. Just:\n# Create fork via Tiger CLI\ntiger db fork main-db --name security-agent-fork\n\n# Boom. Ready to use.\n\nThis enabled true multi-agent architecture without the usual infrastructure headaches.\n2. PostgreSQL's Rich Feature Set\nUsing pg_trgm for semantic search felt like discovering a superpower. No external search engine needed - just Postgres doing what it does best.\n3. Developer Experience\nTiger's dashboard, monitoring, and CLI made development smooth. Seeing real-time activity graphs across forks was incredibly satisfying.\nThe Performance\nI expected some overhead from multiple database connections, but the system analyzes a 200-line file with all 4 agents in under 2 seconds. Zero-copy forks really are zero overhead.\nFinding Real Issues\nWhen I ran my own code through it, the Best Practices agent found 10 legitimate improvements I hadn't noticed. This went from \"hackathon project\" to \"tool I'll actually use\" real quick.\nHow Natural It Felt\nThe fork-based architecture just makes sense. Each agent having its own workspace is intuitive - it mirrors how human teams work.\nChallenge 1: Getting Fork Credentials\nInitially struggled with the Tiger CLI on Windows PowerShell. Solution: Used the web dashboard to create forks and grab connection strings manually. Worked perfectly.\nLearning: Have fallbacks. The coordinator gracefully handles missing fork URLs by using the main DB.\nChallenge 2: Balancing Fork Usage\nWith Tiger's free tier (4 services total: 1 main + 3 forks), I had to think strategically about which agents needed isolation. This constraint actually led to better architecture.\nLearning: Forks aren't free infrastructure - use them intentionally where they provide real value.\nChallenge 3: Merge Conflicts\nInitially had agents overwriting each other's results. Fixed by:\nAgent-specific tables in each fork\nTimestamp-based ordering\nClear merge strategy in coordinator\nLearning: Even with isolated forks, you need a clean data flow design.\n1. Earlier Integration Testing\nI built each agent independently, then integrated. Should have tested the full pipeline sooner - caught some edge cases late.\n2. More Language Support\nCurrently focused on Python. With more time, I'd add robust support for JavaScript, Java, Go, etc. The agent architecture makes this straightforward.\n3. Async from the Start\nThe ThreadPoolExecutor works great, but full async/await would be even cleaner:\nasync def analyze_code():\n    results = await asyncio.gather(\n        security_agent.analyze(code),\n        quality_agent.analyze(code),\n        performance_agent.analyze(code)\n    )\n\n1. Database Forks Enable New Architectures\nBefore Tiger, true multi-agent systems required microservices, message queues, or complex coordination. Forks make it trivial.\n2. PostgreSQL is Underrated for AI Systems\nWe reach for vector databases and specialized tools, but Postgres + extensions handles 90% of use cases beautifully.\n3. Start Simple, Scale Smart\nMy initial plan had 6 agents and complex orchestration. Focusing on 4 well-implemented agents was the right call.\nWith the foundation solid, here's what's next:\nAI-Powered Fix Generation: Use Claude API to automatically generate code fixes\nGitHub Integration: Analyze entire repositories, generate PR comments\nHistorical Tracking: Use TimescaleDB features to track code quality over time\nTeam Features: Multi-user support, project management, quality dashboards\nCI/CD Integration: Run as part of automated pipelines\nMore Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust support\nLive Demo: https://code-cleanup-agents.onrender.com\nGitHub: https://github.com/LuminArk-AI/code-cleanup-agents.git\nSetup Instructions:\nGet Tiger Data account\nCreate databases\nClone this repo\nAdd your database URLs to .env\nRun python app.py\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\n\nBuilding Code Cleanup Agents taught me that the right infrastructure unlocks new possibilities. Tiger Data's Agentic Postgres features - especially zero-copy forks - enabled an architecture that would have been impractical with traditional databases.\nThis isn't just a hackathon project. I'm using it on my own code, it's finding real issues, and the agent-based architecture is extensible for countless improvements.\nThe future of development tooling is multi-agent systems. Agentic Postgres makes that future practical today.\nBuilt with: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Tiger Data, SQLAlchemy, and lots of coffee ☕\nGitHub: https://github.com/LuminArk-AI\nThanks to Tiger Data and the DEV community for an amazing challenge!",

      "link": "https://dev.to/freederia-research/scalable-microfiber-alignment-via-dynamic-field-gradient-electrospinning-18jk",
      "description": "This research proposes a novel system for aligning microfiber structures during electrospinning, leveraging dynamically modulated electric field gradients to achieve unprecedented control over fiber orientation and architecture. Unlike existing methods relying on static collectors or complex post-processing, our system integrates real-time feedback and precise field manipulation, enabling scalable, high-throughput fabrication of aligned microfibers for advanced composite materials and biomedical applications. We anticipate a 30-50% increase in composite tensile strength and a significant reduction in manufacturing costs compared to current techniques, paving the way for broader adoption in industries ranging from aerospace to healthcare.\n1. Introduction\nElectrospinning is a versatile technique for producing continuous nanofibers from polymer solutions. However, achieving controlled fiber alignment remains a crucial challenge limiting the full potential of these materials. Current methods involve static charged collectors, rotating drums, or complex patterned electrodes, all of which suffer from limitations in scalability, throughput, and alignment precision. This research presents a novel approach utilizing dynamically modulated electric field gradients to steer fibers during the electrospinning process, achieving high-degree alignment in a scalable and controlled manner.\n2. Theoretical Framework\nThe electrospinning process is governed by electrostatic forces acting on the charged polymer jet. The trajectory of the jet is determined by the electric field distribution between the needle and the collector. By dynamically modulating the electric field, we can manipulate the jet trajectory in real-time, guiding the fibers towards desired alignment patterns.\nLet E(r,t) represent the electric field vector at position r and time t. The force F acting on a charged polymer jet element is given by:\nF = qE\nwhere q is the charge density of the jet. Analyzing the jet trajectory involves solving the equations of motion, taking into account viscosity, surface tension, and external forces.  However, a simplified, applicable model allows an understanding of the behavior:\nd²r/dt² = (q/m) * E(r, t) - (η/m) * (dr/dt) - (2T/r) * n̂\nWhere:\nr is the position vector of the jet element\nm is the mass of the jet element\nη is the viscosity of the polymer solution\nT is the surface tension\nn̂ is the outward normal vector to the jet element's surface.\nThe dynamic field modulation strategy dynamically adjusts the position and intensity of the electric fields generated for trajectory control given the above differential equations.\n3. System Design and Methodology\nThe experimental setup comprises three main components: a high-voltage power supply, a custom-designed dynamic electrode array, and a high-speed camera system. The dynamic electrode array consists of an array of individually controllable micro-electrodes capable of generating precise electric field gradients. The high-speed camera tracks the trajectory of the electrospinning jet in real-time.\n  Electrode Control Algorithm: A closed-loop feedback control system monitors the jet trajectory using image processing and adjusts the voltage applied to the electrode array to maintain desired alignment. Reinforcement learning is implemented – specifically, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm – to learn optimal voltage modulation patterns for varying polymer solutions and desired alignment angles.  The reward function prioritizes fiber alignment measured (alignment = 1 - standard deviation of the tangent angle of the fibers), and penalizes instability (high trajectory deviation).\n  Polymer Solution Preparation: Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions with varying concentrations are prepared in distilled water. The concentration ranges from 5 wt% to 15 wt% to optimize the polymer spinning parameters for alignment. The viscosity range is from 200cp to 4000cp.\n  Experimental Procedure:  A laboratory electrospinner produces the polymer jets. The dynamic electrode array creates pathing control. A high-speed camera (framerate 1000fps) records the jet as well as the resulting aligned fibers and a vision system extracts fiber positions. The data obtainment module (equipped with an on-board RTX4090 GPU) is designed to record and analyze approximately 300,000 frames (and associated vector data – PEOcentroid coordinates) per run according to the layout below.\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n4. Data Analysis and Evaluation\nThe high-speed camera footage is processed using image analysis algorithms to track fiber trajectories and determine the degree of alignment. ImageJ, a public domain image processing program, is used to process the video structure.\nPolar Order Parameter: This parameter quantifies the degree of fiber alignment, ranging from 0 (random) to 1 (perfectly aligned). Calculated via the Fourier transformation of the pixel intensity along the fiber direction.\nLongitudinal Density: Calculated by averaging the number of fibers per unit length in a given orientation.  Monitored by the vision system integrated in the experimental set-up.\n Statistical Analysis: ANOVA is utilized for assessing the effect of each experiment against the baseline case of random design and standard deviation analysis for validation.\n5.  Expected Results and Commercialization Potential\nWe anticipate achieving a polar order parameter of > 0.9 for a 15 wt% PEO solution and demonstrating a doubling of microfiber density through optimized field gradients as compared to standard, unmodulated electrospinning. This level of control unlocks a wide range of applications:\n  High-performance composites: Aligned microfibers reinforce polymers, increasing strength and stiffness.\n  Biomedical scaffolds:  Controlled fiber orientation promotes cell adhesion and tissue regeneration.\n  Sensor fabrics: Tightly bundled aligned fibers change their electrical properties in reaction to external stimuli, such as shear or temperature.\nCommercialization will initially focus on the composite material sector, targeting applications in automotive and aerospace industries. Within 5 years, we expect the technology to be integrated in industrial-scale electrospinning production lines and the annual market value for controlled aligned microfiber architecture to reach 500M$.\n6. Conclusion\nThis research proposes a novel, scalable, and highly controllable electrospinning system that leverages dynamically modulated electric field gradients for high-degree microfiber alignment. The combination of machine learning feedback and dedicated hardware creates a pathway toward producing advanced materials with unprecedented control over alignment and architecture, paving the way for transformative impacts across multiple industries. Supplemental material, including the PPO training loop and MATLAB code with the data analysis pipeline can be furnished upon request for validation purposes.\nThis research tackles a major challenge in materials science: precisely aligning nanofibers produced via electrospinning. Electrospinning is fantastic - it’s a relatively simple and inexpensive technique for creating incredibly thin fibers from polymer solutions, with potential uses ranging from strong composite materials to biomedical scaffolds that encourage tissue growth. However, traditionally, getting these fibers to line up in a controlled way has been difficult, limiting their full potential. This new research offers a clever, scalable solution by dynamically manipulating the electric field during the spinning process, a considerable departure from existing approaches.\n1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis: Steering Fibers with Electricity\nAt its core, electrospinning involves forcing a charged liquid (the polymer solution) from a nozzle using an electric field.  As the liquid emerges, it stretches into a thin jet that travels towards a collector, eventually solidifying into a fiber. The problem?  The jet’s path and, therefore, the fiber’s alignment are heavily influenced by the electric field. Traditional methods rely on static collectors (like a plate) or rotating drums to induce alignment. This works to a degree, but it’s often limited in scalability – rotating drums can handle only small areas – and precise control is hard to achieve.  Think of trying to herd sheep with a static fence versus dynamically adjusting a barrier to keep them moving in the right direction.\nThe breakthrough here is dynamic field-gradient electrospinning.  Instead of rigidly shaping the electric field, the researchers create an array of micro-electrodes that can individually control the electric field in real time. It's like having a customizable magnetic field that can guide the jet precisely where you want it to go. This system incorporates real-time feedback, meaning it \"watches\" the jet’s trajectory with a high-speed camera and adjusts the electric fields on the fly to correct any deviations. This is a substantial step up because it doesn’t just attempt alignment upfront; it actively corrects for imperfections as they happen.\nA key technology enabling this is Reinforcement Learning (specifically, Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO). This isn't just simple programming; it’s a form of Artificial Intelligence.  The PPO algorithm “learns” the best patterns of voltage adjustments for the electrode array to achieve a desired degree of alignment. It essentially teaches itself how to steer the jet by trial-and-error, maximizing a “reward” (high alignment, minimal instability). Imagine teaching a robot to play a video game: it starts randomly, but gradually learns the optimal moves to achieve a high score. Here, the “score” is fiber alignment.\nThe technical advantage lies in the ability to achieve significantly better alignment and control than static methods, while also being scalable for industrial production. The limitation might be the computational cost of running the real-time feedback loop and the PPO algorithm, especially for very complex polymer solutions and demanding alignment requirements.   However, with increasing computing power, this becomes less of a concern. The approach’s relative novelty also means further optimization could yield even better results; existing PPO implementations might not yet be fully tuned for this specific electrospinning problem.\n2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation: The Physics Behind the Steering\nThe foundation of this system is understanding the physics of charged particles in an electric field. The force acting on the polymer jet, F = qE, is the core concept – a charged particle (the jet) experiences a force proportional to the electric field strength.  \nThe complexity arises from the jet's behavior.  It's not just a simple particle; it’s a viscous fluid with surface tension undergoing continuous deformation. The differential equation d²r/dt² = (q/m) * E(r, t) - (η/m) * (dr/dt) - (2T/r) * n̂ attempts to capture this. Let's break it down:\n  d²r/dt²:  Acceleration of the jet element (how quickly its position changes).\n  (q/m) * E(r, t): The force due to the electric field (as described above).\n  ** (η/m) * (dr/dt)**:  Drag force due to viscosity (polymer’s stickiness slowing down the jet).  Higher viscosity polymers are harder to steer.\n  ** (2T/r) * n̂**:  Force due to surface tension (the tendency of the fluid to minimize its surface area, influencing its shape).\nThe beauty of this equation is that it highlights how the electric field, viscosity, and surface tension interact to determine the jet’s trajectory.  The system doesn’t just apply a force; it cleverly manipulates this interaction to achieve alignment.\nThe PPO algorithm builds on this understanding. It doesn’t directly solve this equation (which is extremely complex). Instead, it learns a control policy (i.e., a mapping from current state to voltage adjustments) that, over time, leads to the desired jet trajectory and, consequently, fiber alignment. The reward function prioritizes two things: maximizing the polar order parameter (explained in section 4) and minimizing the jet's instability. This “teaching” process avoids the need to painstakingly calculate every possible jet trajectory, making the system adaptive to different polymer solutions and desired alignment angles.\n3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method: Seeing the Invisible and Measuring Alignment\nThe experimental setup is elegantly designed. A standard electrospinning setup generates the polymer jet. However, instead of a static collector, they have their star player:  the dynamic electrode array. Each electrode is individually controllable, creating a flexible electric field landscape. A high-speed camera (1000fps!) captures the jet’s movement, rapidly recording thousands of images per second. A vision system analyzes these images to pinpoint the jet’s position and trajectory. To handle the volume of data, the system is equipped with a powerful GPU (RTX4090) - kind of like a supercharged video editor.\nThe data analysis is equally important.  Instead of just looking at whether the fibers are generally aligned, they use sophisticated metrics.\n  Polar order parameter: This is the crucial metric. It's calculated using a Fourier transform of the pixel intensity along the fiber direction. Effectively, it identifies the dominant direction of the fibers. A value of 1 means perfect alignment (all fibers pointing in the same direction), while 0 indicates random orientation.\n  Longitudinal density: Simply the number of fibers per unit length in a specific orientation.  Higher density equates to better packing and potentially improved material properties.\n  Statistical analysis (ANOVA): used to evaluate the effect from variations to the base.\nImageJ, a familiar tool to many researchers, is used to process the video data. This shows a commitment to using widely accessible and validated software for reliable data analysis.\n4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration: Better Materials, Bigger Markets\nThe reported results are compelling. The researchers anticipate achieving a polar order parameter of > 0.9 for a 15 wt% PEO solution – truly impressive – meaning the fibers are almost perfectly aligned.  They also expect a doubling of microfiber density compared to standard electrospinning, implying a potentially dramatic improvement in composite material properties.\nLet's consider a practical example: think of reinforcing a plastic car bumper. Traditional bumpers are often made of plastic filled with randomly oriented fibers. This limits their strength. With aligned microfibers – such as those produced by this new system – the composite material becomes significantly stronger and stiffer in the direction of the fibers, improving impact resistance and potentially allowing for lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. This is one of the key paths to industrial adoption.\nThe biomedical application is equally promising. Aligned microfibers mimic the structure of natural tissues better than randomly oriented ones. This aligns with standardized research in tissue engineering for scaffolds which facilitate cellular alignment. Consequently, scaffolds generated by this approach could promote faster healing and tissue regeneration.\nThe envisioned commercialization strategy focuses initially on the composite material sector, targeting the automotive and aerospace industries.  The market value projection of $500 million within 5 years is ambitious but plausible, given the potential for improved material performance and reduced manufacturing costs.\n5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation: Ensuring Reliability\nThe system's reliability rests on several key elements. The use of a closed-loop feedback control system ensures continuous correction of the jet trajectory, preventing drift and maintaining high alignment. The PPO algorithm, through its iterative learning process, adapts to variations in polymer solutions and environmental conditions. MATLAB code and the PPO training loop are offered for validation, a transparency that enhances credibility.\nThe mathematical model (d²r/dt² = …) is validated by comparing its predictions to experimental observations. The crucial goal is to demonstrate that changes in the electric field, as predicted by the model, translate into predictable changes in the jet’s trajectory and, ultimately, fiber alignment. By tuning the electrode voltages and monitoring the resulting fiber orientation, the researchers can verify that their control system is accurately influencing the jet’s path.\nThe real-time control algorithm's performance is shown by the high polar order parameter achieved. While not explicitly stated, repeated experiments could provide evidence of unpredictable extreme variance. If this system consistently achieves low variance, this further validates the algorithm's reliability.\n6. Adding Technical Depth: Distinguishing the Innovation\nWhat sets this research apart from existing attempts at aligning electrospun fibers? Many systems rely on complex electrode patterns or mechanically manipulating the collector. These approaches are often difficult to scale and require precise fabrication. This system’s innovation is in the dynamic field manipulation driven by reinforcement learning. It's flexible, adaptive, and doesn’t require rigid hardware designs.\nCompared to other research using machine learning for electrospinning, this work likely emphasizes the real-time feedback loop and the closed-loop control system. Most prior studies have focused on optimizing a single electrospinning parameter, while this system dynamically adjusts the electric field based on the jet’s trajectory, contributing to the significant advancements in alignment control. It's the combination of real-time imaging, closed-loop control, and machine learning that drives the high degree of alignment and scalability. It has laid the important foundation for industrial-scale electrospinning fabrication processes.\nIn conclusion, this research represents a significant advancement in electrospinning technology. By integrating dynamic electric field manipulation, real-time feedback, and reinforcement learning, the researchers have created a scalable and highly controllable system for producing precisely aligned microfibers, opening exciting new possibilities for advanced materials and biomedical applications.\nThis document is a part of the Freederia Research Archive.

      "description": "In a decisive move, OpenAI announced that the arrival of superintelligent AI—capable of improving itself—could carry “potentially catastrophic” risks if left unchecked. The company underscored that while the promise of next-generation AI remains enormous—ranging from breakthroughs in drug discovery to climate modelling—so too are the stakes for control, alignment and global coordination. These warnings matter not just to tech firms and regulators, but also to businesses, policymakers and everyday citizens who will live with the outcomes of how AI develops.\nBackground & Context\nOpenAI points out that current models are already “80% of the way to an AI researcher” and that they may soon help make new scientific discoveries. The speed of advancement—driven by rising compute, better architectures and broader data—has outpaced societal readiness.\nIn response, OpenAI had previously published a “Preparedness” framework to address catastrophic risks, including autonomous replication, misuse in cyber/biological domains and alignment failures. In its latest announcement (Nov 6, 2025), OpenAI publicly warned that systems capable of recursive self-improvement—i.e., improving their own capacities without human oversight—are nearing feasibility, and that deploying them without robust control would be irresponsible.\nExpert Quotes / Voices\n“The potential upsides are enormous; we treat the risks of superintelligent systems as potentially catastrophic.”\n“AI progress is accelerating far faster than most realise. The world still perceives AI as chatbots and assistants, but today’s systems already outperform top human minds in complex intellectual tasks.”\nMarket / Industry Comparisons\nartificial general intelligence (AGI). Each company is developing internal “red-team” structures to test and contain potential harms, but coordination remains minimal.\nThe current debate mirrors earlier technological inflection points—such as the dawn of nuclear energy and the internet—where innovation surged ahead of governance. OpenAI’s call for a shared “AI resilience ecosystem” could serve as a foundation for future global AI governance.\nImplications & Why It Matters\nFor governments, fragmented national laws may prove ineffective. OpenAI’s message strengthens the case for global AI treaties or cooperative frameworks similar to those used in climate or nuclear governance.\nFor society, this warning reframes AI as not merely a productivity tool but a transformative—and potentially existential—force. Managing this transition will require new levels of public awareness, policy literacy and ethical engagement.\nWhat’s Next\nShared global safety research between frontier labs to pool empirical findings.\nWrap-Up\nOur Take\nThis moment marks a paradigm shift where AI is no longer about progress alone—it’s about preservation. OpenAI’s warning is a wake-up call for humanity to balance innovation with integrity. Building superintelligent systems demands not just smarter algorithms but wiser governance. The true race ahead isn’t for AGI—it’s for alignment, responsibility, and shared human values.",

Tiger CLI : Service Orchestration\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: Tiger CLI provides command-line interface for managing Tiger Cloud services, enabling programmatic DB operations & service lifecycle management.\nHow I Used It: Automated the creation and management of Tiger services for multi-agent coordination. The CLI integration allows GitResume to dynamically provision database infrastructure for each analysis session.\nWhy It's Better: Eliminates manual database setup, enables on-demand scaling, & provides programmatic control over DB resources. This transforms GitResume from a static application to a dynamic, infrastructure-aware system.\n// Automated Tiger service creation for multi-agent system\nasync initializeMultiAgentSystem(username: string): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    // Create Tiger service programmatically\n    const serviceResult = execSync('./bin/tiger service create --name advanced-gitresume', {\n      encoding: 'utf-8',\n      cwd: process.cwd()\n    });\n\n    this.tigerServiceId = serviceResult.trim().split(' ').pop() || '';\n    console.log(`🎯 Tiger Service Created: ${this.tigerServiceId}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('⚠️ Tiger service creation failed, try again');\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n2. Fast Zero-Copy Forks : Agent Isolation\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: Zero-copy database forks create instant, isolated database instances without data duplication, enabling parallel processing with complete data isolation.\nHow I Used It: Each of the 4 AI agents(code-architect, tech-scout, career-advisor, innovation-detector) gets its own dedicated database fork, allowing true parallel analysis without data conflicts.\nWhy It's Revolutionary: Traditional databases require expensive data replication for isolation. Tiger's zero-copy forks enable instant agent workspaces, reducing setup time from mins to secs & enabling real-time multi-agent collaboration.\n// Create isolated workspaces for each AI agent\nconst agents = ['code-architect', 'tech-scout', 'career-advisor', 'innovation-detector'];\n\nfor (const agent of agents) {\n  try {\n    const forkResult = execSync(`./bin/tiger fork create --service ${this.tigerServiceId} --name ${agent}-workspace`, {\n      encoding: 'utf-8',\n      cwd: process.cwd()\n    });\n\n    const forkId = forkResult.trim().split(' ').pop() || '';\n    this.agentForks.set(agent, forkId);\n\n    // Initialize agent-specific schema\n    await this.initializeAgentWorkspace(agent, forkId);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(`⚠️ Fork creation failed for ${agent}, using shared workspace`);\n  }\n}\n\n3. Agent Workspace Schema Design\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: Full PostgreSQL compatibility with agent-specific table structures & indexing for optimized AI workloads.\nHow I Used It: Each agent fork contains specialized tables for insights, learnings, & pattern detection, enabling agents to build knowledge over time & share insights across analysis sessions.\nWhy It's Powerful: Transforms AI agents from stateless functions to learning entities with persistent memory, enabling continuous improvement & cross-session knowledge retention.\n// Agent-specific schema for learning and insights\nprivate async initializeAgentWorkspace(agent: string, forkId: string): Promise<void> {\n  const schema = `\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${agent}_insights (\n      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n      repository TEXT,\n      pattern TEXT,\n      insight TEXT,\n      confidence FLOAT,\n      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n    );\n\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${agent}_learnings (\n      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n      pattern_type TEXT,\n      learning TEXT,\n      success_rate FLOAT,\n      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n    );\n  `;\n\n  console.log(`📊 Initialized workspace for ${agent}`);\n}\n\n4. Parallel Agent Coordination\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: Multi-database coordination enabling simultaneous operations across multiple isolated environments with eventual consistency.\nHow I Used It: Orchestrated 4 specialized agents to analyze repositories simultaneously, with each agent contributing unique insights that are aggregated into comprehensive career profiles.\nWhy It's Game-Changing: Reduced analysis time from 1-2 mins (sequential) to under 10 secs (parallel), while maintaining data integrity & enabling sophisticated cross-agent pattern detection.\n// Parallel agent execution with real-time coordination\nasync analyzeWithAdvancedAgents(username: string, repositories: string[]) {\n  // Initialize multi-agent system with Tiger forks\n  await this.initializeMultiAgentSystem(username);\n\n  // Run all agents in parallel across repositories\n  const agentPromises = repositories.map(async (repo) => {\n    return await this.runParallelAgentAnalysis(username, repo);\n  });\n\n  // Aggregate results from all agents\n  const repoAnalyses = await Promise.all(agentPromises);\n\n  // Cross-repository pattern detection\n  const crossRepoPatterns = await this.detectCrossRepoPatterns(allInsights);\n\n  return {\n    insights: allInsights,\n    careerProfile: await this.generateCareerProfile(allInsights, crossRepoPatterns),\n    crossRepoPatterns,\n    learningEvolution: await this.updateAgentLearnings(allInsights)\n  };\n}\n\n5. pg_text Search : Semantic Pattern Detection\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities with to_tsvector and plainto_tsquery functions, enabling semantic analysis & pattern matching across large text datasets.\nHow I Used It: Implemented cross-repository semantic analysis to detect technology patterns, coding approaches, & architectural decisions across a developer's entire portfolio. The system searches for semantic relationships between repositories using natural language processing.\nWhy It's Revolutionary: Traditional keyword matching misses semantic relationships. pg_text search enables GitResume to understand that \"authentication,\" \"auth,\" \"JWT,\" & \"OAuth\" are related concepts, providing deeper insights into a developer's expertise patterns across projects.\n// pg_text search implementation for semantic pattern detection\nprivate async pgTextSearchPatterns(insights: AgentInsight[]): Promise<any[]> {\n  const searchTerms = ['react', 'typescript', 'api', 'authentication', 'testing', 'deployment'];\n  const patterns: any[] = [];\n\n  for (const term of searchTerms) {\n    // Real PostgreSQL full-text search query\n    const query = `\n      SELECT repository, pattern, insight,\n             ts_rank(to_tsvector('english', insight), plainto_tsquery($1)) as relevance\n      FROM agent_insights\n      WHERE to_tsvector('english', insight) @@ plainto_tsquery($1)\n      ORDER BY relevance DESC\n      LIMIT 10;\n    `;\n\n    if (semanticMatches.length > 1) {\n      patterns.push({\n        pattern: `semantic-${term}`,\n        searchMethod: 'pg_text_search',\n        relevanceScore: semanticMatches.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.score, 0) / semanticMatches.length\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  return patterns;\n}\n\n6. Fluid Storage : Dynamic Resource Scaling\n\n\nAgentic Postgres Feature: Intelligent storage management that dynamically scales resources based on workload complexity, enabling efficient processing of varying data sizes without manual configuration.\nHow I Used It: Implemented adaptive repository analysis where large or complex repositories (10MB+ or high star count) automatically triggers distributed processing across multiple agent forks, while smaller repositories use optimized with single-fork processing.\nWhy It's Game-Changing: Eliminates the \"one-size-fits-all\" limitation of traditional databases. GitResume automatically adapts its processing strategy based on repository complexity, ensuring optimal performance whether analyzing a simple script or a massive enterprise codebase.\n// Fluid Storage: Dynamic scaling based on repository complexity\nprivate async fetchRepositoryData(username: string, repo: string): Promise<any> {\n  // Assess repository complexity for intelligent scaling\n  const repoComplexity = await this.assessRepositoryComplexity(username, repo, token);\n\n  if (repoComplexity.isLarge) {\n    console.log(`Using Fluid Storage for large repository: ${repo}`);\n    return await this.fluidStorageFetch(username, repo, token);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Using standard fetch for repository: ${repo}`);\n    return await this.standardRepositoryFetch(username, repo, token);\n  }\n}\n\nprivate async fluidStorageFetch(username: string, repo: string, token: string): Promise<any> {\n  // Distributed fetching across multiple agent forks for large repositories\n  const agents = Array.from(this.agentForks.keys());\n\n  // Fluid Storage: Distribute file analysis across agent forks\n  const importantFiles = (tree.tree || []).filter((file: any) =>\n    file.type === 'blob' && this.isAnalysisWorthy(file)\n  ).slice(0, 20); // Intelligent file limiting\n\n  return {\n    info: repoInfo,\n    tree: tree.tree || [],\n    readme,\n    fluidStorage: {\n      used: true,\n      agentsUsed: agents.length,\n      filesDistributed: importantFiles.length,\n      distributionStrategy: 'agent-fork-based'\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nProject

in developer tooling. The database fork concept is transformative - giving each AI agent its own isolated workspace while maintaining data consistency is exactly what this multi-agent system needed. The documentation is surprisingly comprehensive for a cutting-edge platform, making the learning curve smoother than expected for my first-time experience with Agentic Postgres.\nWhat Surprised Me\n\n\nThe performance improvement was staggering. Moving from my previous non-Tiger implementation (1-2 mins) to Tiger Cloud's Agentic Postgres (5-10 secs) wasn't just optimization, it fundamentally changed the entire user experience from \"submit and wait\" to \"watch real-time analysis.\" The efficiency & speed of Tiger Cloud services exceeded my expectations.\nKey Challenges & Solutions\n\n\nChallenge 1: Free Tier Service Limitations\n• Problem: Only 2 services per free tier, but I initially wanted 4+ dedicated agent workspaces.\nReality Check: Hit this limit immediately during development.\nSolution: Redesigned architecture with intelligent fallback - agents share workspaces when fork creation fails.\nLearning: Always design for graceful degradation, especially with cloud resource constraints.\nChallenge 2: GitHub API Rate Limits Crisis\n• Problem: First local test consumed 5023+ requests in one analysis run, hitting the 5000/hour limit.\nImpact: Had to wait 1 hour before I could test again - full panic mode!\nSolution: Complete optimization overhaul using Tiger Cloud's caching capabilities.\nResult: Reduced to <100 requests per analysis through intelligent file filtering and Tiger storage.\n// Emergency optimization that saved the project\nconst importantFiles = tree.tree?.filter((file: any) =>\n  file.type === 'blob' && (\n    file.path.includes('README') ||\n    file.path.endsWith('.js') ||\n    file.path.endsWith('.ts') ||\n    file.path === 'package.json'\n  )\n).slice(0, 10); // Ruthless limiting to essential files only\n\nChallenge 3: Tiger Cloud Service Outages\n• Problem: Encountered Tiger Cloud outages during development.\nReality: Had to build robust fallback systems for production reliability.\nSolution: Implemented some fallbacks to maintain functionality even when Tiger services are unavailable.\nDevelopment Reality Check\n\n\nThis was my first experience with Tiger Cloud, Tiger CLI, & Agentic Postgres, essentially learning everything from scratch. Despite being new to the platform, I managed to build a working multi-agent system in over 20 hrs of development. The fact that a newcomer could achieve this level of integration speaks volumes about Tiger Cloud's developer experience.\nAdditional complexity: This was also my first Next.js project, adding another learning curve, but the combination worked seamlessly.\nKey Learnings\n\n\n\nAgentic Postgres isn't just a database, it's a platform for building intelligent, collaborative systems.\nZero-copy forks enable architectural patterns that simply weren't possible with traditional databases.\nResource constraints drive innovation - the free tier limitations forced better design decisions, for me atleast.\nPerformance optimization through intelligent caching can be more impactful than code optimization.\nAlways plan for service outages - robust fallbacks are essential for production applications.\nMy Experience building with Agentic Postgres\n\n\nTiger Cloud transformed what could have been a slow, batch-processing tool into a real-time, interactive developer assistant. The 750MB storage limit on the free tier proved more than adequate, & the service creation limitations actually led to a more efficient architecture.\nBottom line: Tiger Cloud didn't just improve my application, it enabled an entirely new category of developer productivity tool that provides immediate, actionable value.\nThank You\n\n\nBuilding GitResume has been an incredible journey for me. Tiger Cloud didn't just provide a database - it provided a new way of thinking about AI Agents & Applications. The ability to give each AI agent its own workspace through zero-copy forks opened up architectural possibilities I'd never imagined.\nTo the Tiger Data team: Thank you for creating a technology that enables developers like me to build things that seemed impossible just months ago. The seamless integration between Tiger CLI, database forks, & Agentic Postgres features made this hackathon project feel less like wrestling with infrastructure and more like pure innovation.\nTo the developer community: GitResume exists because we all know that our code tells our story better than any traditional resume ever could. I hope this platform helps fellow developers showcase their true capabilities & land the opportunities they deserve ✨.\nThe future of developer tools is collaborative AI systems, & Tiger Cloud has given us the foundation to build that future. GitResume is just the beginning.\nAnd thank you, dear reader, for reading till the end 😊",

      "description": "Sloppy is a Chrome extension that detects \"slop\" (low-quality, AI-generated, templated, repetitive writing) in web pages using Agentic Postgres with real-time multi-agent collaboration. The innovation lies in how each analysis job runs in its own zero-copy database fork where three specialized agents (Collector, Evaluator, Curator) work asynchronously in complete isolation.\nThe web is increasingly filled with AI-generated content that lacks authenticity - generic marketing copy, repetitive templates, keyword-stuffed paragraphs, and low-value \"content mill\" writing. Readers need a way to quickly identify this \"slop\" to make informed decisions about content quality.\nSloppy analyzes web pages in real-time, assigning each paragraph a quality score based on:\nTemplate phrase detection: Identifies overused buzzwords (\"cutting-edge\", \"world-class\", \"leverage synergy\")\nRepetition analysis: Detects repeated sentence structures and phrases using pg_trgm\nSemantic similarity: Uses pgvector to find suspiciously similar paragraphs\nAI writing patterns: Flags generic transitions like \"It's important to note\", \"Moreover\", \"Furthermore\"\nLow lexical diversity: Identifies vocabulary repetition and generic language\nWhat makes Sloppy unique is its fork-based architecture - every analysis runs in a dedicated database fork, enabling true agent isolation, parallel processing, and fearless experimentation without polluting the main database.\nTraditional approaches would require complex application-level coordination, locking mechanisms, and careful state management. With Tiger's zero-copy forks:\n✅ Instant isolation: Each job gets its own database snapshot in milliseconds\n✅ Zero overhead: No data duplication, forks share underlying storage\n✅ Clean rollback: Failed analyses simply discard their fork\n✅ Parallel execution: Multiple jobs run simultaneously without interference\n✅ Agent collaboration: Agents communicate through fork-local tables\nGitHub: https://github.com/AamishB/Sloppy\nThe Chrome extension analyzing a webpage with the Sloppy icon showing the quality score:\n\nReal-time WebSocket updates show progress as agents work through the analysis\nColor-coded highlights directly on the webpage showing problematic content:\n\nYellow highlights for medium slop (20-60%), red for high slop (>60%)\nHovering over highlights reveals specific issues detected:\n\nParagraph-level scoring with reasons: template phrases, repetition, AI patterns\nThe extension popup showing overall quality metrics:\n\nOverall score: 59% - indicating significant quality issues detected\nClone the repo: git clone https://github.com/AamishB/Sloppy.git\n\nInstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nSet up environment variables in .env (DATABASE_URL, TIGER_CLI_PATH)\nInitialize Database Schema: psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/schema.sql\n\nRun the server: uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --port 8000\n\nLoad the extension/ folder in Chrome as an unpacked extension\nVisit any webpage and click the Sloppy icon to analyze\nTest page included: test_page.html contains intentional AI slop for testing\nEvery analysis job creates its own fork using Tiger CLI:\n# Create isolated fork for this job\ntiger service fork job_name --now --name fork_page_abc123 --no-set-default\n\nWhy this matters:\nIsolation: Each job operates in complete isolation without locks or conflicts\nPerformance: Zero-copy means instant fork creation (< 100ms vs minutes for traditional clones)\nClean slate: Failed analyses don't pollute the main database\nParallel execution: 10+ jobs can run simultaneously, each in their own fork\nThree specialized agents collaborate within each fork:\n\nKey code snippet (from fastapi_app/main.py):\nasync def run_agents_with_fork(job_id: str, raw: str):\n    \"\"\"Orchestrate agents in isolated fork\"\"\"\n\n    # Create zero-copy fork\n    fork_id = await create_tiger_fork(job_id)\n\n    try:\n        # Agent 1: Collect & embed\n        paragraphs = split_paragraphs(raw)\n        embeddings = embed_texts(paragraphs, model)\n        await insert_paragraphs(fork_id, paragraphs, embeddings)\n\n        # Agent 2: Evaluate in parallel (uses fork connection)\n        tasks = [evaluate_paragraph(p, fork_id) for p in paragraphs]\n        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n\n        # Agent 3: Curate results\n        results = await aggregate_evaluations(fork_id)\n\n        # Merge results back to main\n        await merge_fork_results(fork_id, job_id)\n\n    finally:\n        # Clean up fork (instant)\n        await cleanup_tiger_fork(fork_id)\n\nThe Evaluator agent uses Tiger's optimized extensions for powerful hybrid search:\n1. Semantic Similarity (pgvector):\n-- Find semantically similar paragraphs (AI pattern detection)\nSELECT content, embedding <=> $1::vector as distance\nFROM paragraphs\nWHERE embedding <=> $1::vector < 0.3\nORDER BY distance\nLIMIT 5;\n\n2. Full-Text Matching (pg_trgm):\n-- Detect template phrases and repetition\nSELECT content, similarity(content, $1) as sim\nFROM paragraphs\nWHERE content % $1  -- pg_trgm similarity operator\nORDER BY sim DESC;\n\n3. Combined Power:\n# Evaluator agent combines both approaches\nsemantic_matches = await find_similar_embeddings(paragraph, threshold=0.3)\ntemplate_matches = await find_template_phrases(paragraph, templates)\n\nslop_score = calculate_score(\n    semantic_similarity=len(semantic_matches),\n    template_count=len(template_matches),\n    repetition_score=calculate_trigram_similarity(paragraph, all_paragraphs)\n)\n\nThis hybrid approach catches both:\nMeaning-based slop: Paragraphs that say the same thing differently (pgvector)\nPattern-based slop: Repeated phrases and templates (pg_trgm)\nSloppy uses Tiger CLI for automated fork management:\nFork Creation:\ntiger service fork job_name --now --name fork_page_abc123 --no-set-default --no-wait\n\nFork Deletion:\ntiger service delete fork_page_abc123 --confirm --no-wait\n\nSnapshot Creation (for caching):\ntiger service fork snapshot fork_page_abc123\n\nImplementation (Windows-compatible):\ndef create_fork():\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        [TIGER_CLI_PATH, \"service\", \"fork\", service_name, \n         \"--now\", \"--name\", fork_name, \"--no-set-default\"],\n        capture_output=True,\n        encoding='utf-8',\n        timeout=30\n    )\n    return result.returncode, result.stdout, result.stderr\n\n# Run in thread pool for Windows asyncio compatibility\nreturncode, stdout, stderr = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(\n    executor, create_fork\n)\n\nSloppy demonstrates Tiger's fluid storage capabilities:\n1. Data flows through fork lifecycle:\nRaw text → Fork created → Paragraphs inserted → \nEvaluations added → Results aggregated → \nMerged to main → Fork deleted\n\n2. Caching with forks:\n# Check cache in main DB\nif text_hash in cache:\n    return cached_result\n\n# Create fork, run analysis\nfork_id = await create_fork()\nresults = await analyze_in_fork(fork_id)\n\n# Cache results in main DB\nawait cache_results(text_hash, results)\n\n3. Snapshot preservation:\n# Curator agent creates snapshot before fork deletion\nawait create_snapshot(fork_id)  # Preserves state for debugging/auditing\nawait merge_results(fork_id)\nawait delete_fork(fork_id)\n\nWith Tiger's Agentic Postgres:\n⚡ Fork creation: ~50-100ms (zero-copy)\n⚡ Parallel jobs: 10+ concurrent analyses without blocking\n⚡ Cache hit rate: 40-60% (repeated analyses instant)\n⚡ Average analysis time: 5-15 seconds for 20-50 paragraphs\nWithout forks (traditional approach):\n❌ Would require complex application-level locking\n❌ Risk of dirty reads and race conditions\n❌ Difficult to roll back failed analyses\n❌ Limited parallelism due to contention\n1. Zero-Copy Forks Changed Everything\nComing into this challenge, I expected database forks to be expensive. I was wrong. Tiger's zero-copy architecture completely changed how I approach agent orchestration:\nFearless parallelism: I can spin up 10+ analysis jobs simultaneously without worrying about conflicts\nClean architecture: Each job is truly isolated - no more defensive programming around shared state\nInstant cleanup: Failed analyses just discard their fork - no need to carefully undo changes\nThe \"aha moment\" was realizing I could treat database forks like Git branches - cheap, disposable, and merga ble. This mental model transformed my architecture from \"careful shared-state management\" to \"fearless fork-per-job isolation\".\n2. Hybrid Search is Powerful\nCombining pgvector and pg_trgm created something greater than the sum of its parts:\npgvector catches semantic slop: \"This solution offers cutting-edge innovation\" vs \"Our platform provides state-of-the-art technology\" (different words, same empty meaning)\npg_trgm catches pattern slop: Repeated phrases, template structures, generic transitions\nTogether they achieve ~85% accuracy in slop detection (tested on 100+ pages)\n3. Tiger CLI Integration\nThe Tiger CLI is remarkably well-designed:\nClear command structure: tiger service fork <service-id> --now --name <fork-name>\n\nJSON output support for parsing: --output json\n\nFast execution: Commands complete in 100-200ms\nGreat error messages: When I got flags wrong, errors were immediately obvious\nSurprise: The --no-set-default flag was crucial - without it, every fork would become my default service, breaking subsequent forks. This isn't obvious from docs but makes perfect sense for automated fork management.\n1. Windows Subprocess Compatibility\nHit an interesting Windows-specific issue: asyncio.create_subprocess_exec doesn't work on Windows with ProactorEventLoop (raises NotImplementedError). \nSolution: Wrap synchronous subprocess.run with ThreadPoolExecutor:\nexecutor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)\n\ndef create_fork():\n    result = subprocess.run([TIGER_CLI_PATH, ...], capture_output=True)\n    return result.returncode, result.stdout, result.stderr\n\nreturncode, stdout, stderr = await loop.run_in_executor(executor, create_fork)\n\nThis pattern works perfectly and maintains async compatibility.\n2. Fork Lifecycle Management\nInitially struggled with fork cleanup timing:\nToo early → results not yet merged\nToo late → accumulating orphaned forks\nJust right → asyncio.create_task(cleanup_tiger_fork(fork_id)) after results merge\nThe async fire-and-forget pattern lets the main request complete while cleanup happens in background.\n3. UTF-8 Encoding with Tiger CLI\nTiger CLI occasionally outputs special characters (progress indicators, icons). Without explicit UTF-8 handling:\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x90\n\nFix: Always specify encoding:\nsubprocess.run([...], encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\nThe errors='replace' ensures non-UTF-8 bytes don't crash the process.\n1. Fork-Per-Agent Architecture\nCurrently agents share a single fork. Next evolution:\nMain DB\n  ├─ Fork 1: Collector (writes paragraphs)\n  ├─ Fork 2: Evaluator (reads paragraphs, writes evaluations)\n  └─ Fork 3: Curator (reads evaluations, writes results)\n\nEach agent gets its own fork, merging results upstream. This would showcase Tiger's fork merge capabilities even more dramatically.\n2. Historical Analysis with Snapshots\nUse Tiger snapshots to track content quality over time:\n-- Compare article quality across snapshots\nSELECT \n    snapshot_id,\n    created_at,\n    AVG(slop_score) as avg_quality\nFROM evaluations\nGROUP BY snapshot_id\nORDER BY created_at;\n\nThis would enable \"quality regression detection\" - alerting when a website's content quality degrades.\n3. Collaborative Filtering\nUse pgvector to find users with similar taste in content quality:\n-- Find users who rated similar content similarly\nSELECT user_id, \n       embedding <=> $1::vector as taste_similarity\nFROM user_preferences\nORDER BY taste_similarity\nLIMIT 10;\n\nBuild a recommendation system: \"Users who flagged this as slop also flagged...\"\nTiger's Agentic Postgres is a paradigm shift. I came in thinking forks were an interesting optimization. I left convinced they're a fundamentally better way to architect agent systems.\nThe traditional approach (locks, transactions, careful state management) feels archaic now. Why coordinate agents with complex application logic when the database can provide isolation for free?\nKey insight: Database forks are to agent coordination what Git is to code collaboration. Cheap, disposable, mergeable isolation that enables fearless experimentation.\nThank you Tiger team for building something genuinely innovative. Agentic Postgres isn't just faster Postgres - it's a new way of thinking about data and agents.",

      "link": "https://dev.to/freederia-research/autonomous-anomaly-detection-in-extreme-temperature-sensors-utilizing-bayesian-calibration-and-3678",
      "description": "This paper introduces a novel system for autonomously detecting anomalies in high-temperature industrial sensor networks. By combining Bayesian calibration techniques with recursive filtering algorithms, our system achieves a 3x improvement in anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional threshold-based methods. This approach addresses a critical need in industries like aerospace and power generation, where sensor failure can lead to catastrophic consequences. The system's adaptability and ability to self-calibrate minimize the need for manual intervention, reducing operational costs and improving overall system reliability.\n1. Introduction\n극한 환경 계측 기술, particularly in high-temperature environments (e.g., jet engines, geothermal power plants), faces significant challenges regarding sensor reliability and data integrity. Sensor drift, noise, and outright failure are common occurrences, leading to inaccurate measurements and potentially dangerous operational decisions. Traditional anomaly detection methods often rely on fixed thresholds, which are easily disrupted by environmental variations and sensor aging. This paper presents a system leveraging Bayesian calibration and recursive filtering to dynamically adapt to these conditions, improving anomaly detection accuracy and robustness.\n2. Theoretical Framework & Methodology\nOur system employs a hierarchical approach, combining a Bayesian calibration layer with a recursive filter for anomaly detection. The Bayesian calibration component continuously updates the sensor's operational parameters based on observed data, while the recursive filter analyzes the calibrated data stream to identify deviations from expected behavior.\n2.1 Bayesian Calibration for Sensor Drift Compensation\nSensor drift, a primary cause of inaccurate readings, is modeled using a Bayesian framework. We assume the sensor's output, yi, follows a linear model:\nyi = a0 + a1ti + εi\nWhere:\nyi is the sensor reading at time ti.\na0 is the sensor's initial offset.\na1 is the sensor's drift rate.\nεi is the measurement error, assumed to be normally distributed with variance σ2.\nThe prior distributions for a0 and a1 are defined using Gaussian distributions, reflecting our prior knowledge about typical sensor behavior.  The posterior distribution is then computed using Bayes' Theorem:\nP(a0, a1 | y1, ..., yn) ∝ P(y1, ..., yn | a0, a1) * P(a0, a1)\nWhere P(a0, a1) represents the prior distribution and P(y1, ..., yn | a0, a1) is the likelihood function.  The posterior is iteratively updated with each new measurement, providing a dynamically adjusted estimate of the sensor's drift parameters. The Kalman filter is employed to efficiently compute the posterior distribution.\n2.2 Recursive Filtering for Anomaly Detection\nFollowing Bayesian calibration, the recursively filtered data stream is analyzed for anomalies.  We employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the true state of the system, accounting for potential non-linearities introduced by the environment or the sensor itself. The EKF update equations are:\n  Prediction:  x̂k- = Fk-1x̂k-1+\n\n  Update: x̂k+ = x̂k- + Kk(zk - h(x̂k-))\n\n\n\nWhere:\nx̂k+ and x̂k- are the a posteriori and a priori state estimates at time k.\nFk-1 is the state transition matrix.\nzk is the measurement at time k, calibrated by the Bayesian filter output.\nh(x̂k-) is the measurement function.\nKk is the Kalman gain.\nAny significant deviation between the predicted state and the actual measurement (measured by a modified Mahalanobis distance) is flagged as an anomaly.\n3. Experimental Design & Data Acquisition\nThe system was tested using simulated data collected from a commercial high-temperature thermocouple used in a gas turbine engine. The simulation included:\n  Base Case: Stable sensor operation under nominal operating conditions.\n  Drift Scenario:  Linear increase in sensor bias over time, mimicking sensor aging.\n  Noise Scenario: Addition of Gaussian noise to the sensor output, representing thermal fluctuations.\n  Failure Scenario: Sudden, abrupt change in sensor output, simulating a sensor malfunction.\nThe data was generated over a 100-hour period, with measurements taken every 10 seconds.  The simulation parameters (drift rates, noise levels, and failure magnitudes) were randomly selected from pre-defined distributions.  Performance was evaluated based on:\n  Detection Accuracy: Percentage of anomalies correctly identified.\n  False Alarm Rate: Percentage of false positives (normal behavior mistakenly flagged as anomaly).\n  Time to Detection: Time elapsed between anomaly onset and detection.\n4. Results and Discussion\nThe results demonstrate a significant improvement in anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional threshold-based methods. Our system achieved a 92% detection accuracy with a 3% false alarm rate, compared to the 45% accuracy and 15% false alarm rate of a standard threshold approach using a fixed offset estimate. The time to detection was consistently less than 60 seconds, allowing for timely intervention.\nTable 1: Performance Comparison\n\n\n\nMetric\nThreshold-Based\nBayesian-EKF\n\n\n\n\nDetection Accuracy\n45%\n92%\n\n\nFalse Alarm Rate\n15%\n3%\n\n\nAvg.

Scalability and Practical Considerations\nThe system architecture is designed for scalability through distributed processing. Individual sensors and their corresponding Bayesian filters and EKF modules can be deployed on edge devices, minimizing network latency and bandwidth requirements.  A centralized management system aggregates anomaly alerts and provides a unified view of the sensor network’s health.\nLong-term scalability involves implementing adaptive learning algorithms that can automatically optimize the system’s parameters based on historical data.  This includes dynamically adjusting the prior distributions for the Bayesian filter and tuning the Kalman gain for the EKF.  We plan to incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance the system’s ability to learn from past errors and improve its overall performance.  For management purposes, cloud or Kubernetes deployments provide flexible scaling options.\n6. Conclusion\nThe proposed system provides a robust and adaptive solution for anomaly detection in 극한 환경 계측 기술. By integrating Bayesian calibration and recursive filtering, we achieve significant improvements in detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and time to detection.  The system's scalable architecture and practical considerations make it well-suited for deployment in critical industrial applications, contributing to improved safety, reliability, and operational efficiency. Future work will focus on incorporating adaptive learning algorithms and extending the system to support a wider range of sensor types and environmental conditions.\n7. Further Research\nThis research tackles a crucial problem in industries like aerospace and power generation: reliably monitoring sensors operating in incredibly harsh, high-temperature environments. Think jet engines running at thousands of degrees or geothermal plants harnessing the Earth’s heat.  These sensors are vital for safety and efficiency, but they are prone to drift, noise, and failure, leading to inaccurate readings and potentially catastrophic consequences. Traditional methods of anomaly detection, relying on simple thresholds, often fail to cope with the constantly changing conditions of these environments. This paper introduces a system that intelligently adapts to these challenges, offering a significant leap in accuracy and reliability.\n1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis: Blending Experience with Math\nThe core idea is to combine two powerful techniques: Bayesian Calibration and Recursive Filtering. Let's unpack those. Bayesian Calibration is like continuously refining your understanding of a sensor's behavior based on its performance over time. Instead of assuming a sensor is perfect, it acknowledges that sensors drift – their readings slowly change over time – and uses new data to correct for this drift. Recursive Filtering, specifically an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in this case, is a way to smooth out noisy data and estimate the “true” state of a system, taking into account potential errors and uncertainties.  Imagine trying to track the speed of a car through heavy rain—recursive filtering is like averaging multiple readings to get a more accurate picture.\nThe key here is integration. Bayesian calibration corrects for sensor drift, providing cleaner data, and the EKF then uses this clean data to detect anomalies. This collaborative approach avoids the pitfalls of traditional threshold-based methods that are easily fooled by sensor drift.\nTechnical Advantages & Limitations: The biggest advantage is improved accuracy, demonstrated by a 3x increase compared to traditional methods.  The system also adapts automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention—a huge benefit in remote or hazardous environments.  However, the complexity of both Bayesian calibration and EKF means the system requires more computational power than simpler threshold-based methods. Additionally, the performance heavily relies on the accuracy of the initial assumptions made about sensor behavior (the “prior” distribution in the Bayesian framework). A poorly defined prior can negatively impact the calibration process.\nTechnology Interaction:  The Bayesian filter acts as a pre-processor, providing cleaned data to the EKF. Without the Bayesian filter, the EKF would struggle to accurately estimate the system state due to persistent sensor drift.  The Kalman Gain within the EKF then adjusts the weight given to each new sensor reading based on its uncertainty – a high-confidence reading contributes more to the state estimate than a noisy one.\n2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation:  A Simple Equation, Powerful Result\nThe heart of the Bayesian calibration lies in a simple linear model: yi = a0 + a1ti + εi\n  yi is the sensor’s reading at a given time.\n  a0 is the sensor’s initial offset (where the reading starts).\n  a1 is the drift rate (how much the reading changes over time).\n  εi is the error – random noise in the measurement.\nThe goal is to figure out what a0 and a1 are, given a series of readings. Bayes' Theorem comes in:  P(a0, a1 | y1, ..., yn) ∝ P(y1, ..., yn | a0, a1) * P(a0, a1). This translates to: \"The probability of a0 and a1 given the sensor readings is proportional to the probability of seeing those sensor readings given a0 and a1, multiplied by our initial belief about a0 and a1.”\nImagine you initially believe most sensors have a small offset and drift slowly (your \"prior\").  As you get more readings, you update your belief – the posterior distribution – based on how the sensor actually behaves. The Kalman filter is a computationally efficient way to do this updating.\nThe EKF then builds on this calibrated data. It uses a set of equations (Prediction and Update steps – see the original paper) to continuously estimate the system’s true state, even in the presence of non-linearities.  The \"modified Mahalanobis distance\" – effectively a measure of how far a sensor reading deviates from the expected value - triggers an anomaly alert.\nExample: Consider a thermocouple measuring the temperature of a turbine blade. Initially, a0 might be estimated as 500°C and a1 as -0.1°C/hour, indicating a slow downward drift.  As data pours in, if the thermocouple consistently reads 510°C, the algorithm adjusts a0 upwards, correcting for the drift.\n3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method: Simulating Reality\nThe system was tested using simulated data from a commercial thermocouple working in a turbine engine. The simulator created four key scenarios:\n Base Case: Normal operation, no issues.\n Drift Scenario:  The thermocouple’s bias slowly increased over time.\n Noise Scenario: Random noise was added to the readings.\n Failure Scenario:  A sudden, drastic change in the output.\nMeasurements were taken every 10 seconds over a 100-hour period. Different parameters—drift rates, noise levels, and the magnitudes of the failures—were randomly chosen.\nExperimental Equipment:  While the core experiment was simulated, high-fidelity thermocouple models were used to create realistic data.  The simulator itself ran on standard computing hardware.\nExperimental Procedure: The simulated data was fed into both the proposed Bayesian-EKF system and a traditional threshold-based method. The performance was then evaluated based on Detection Accuracy, False Alarm Rate, and Time to Detection.\nData Analysis:  Regression analysis was used to model the relationship between sensor drift and detection performance – showing how effectively the Bayesian calibration compensated for the drift. Statistical analysis, such as calculating confidence intervals, helped determine the statistical significance of the observed improvements over the threshold-based method. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the detection accuracy of the Bayesian-EKF method would tell us if we are confident that the method's accuracy is truly higher than 92%.\n4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration:  A Winning Combination\nThe results were clear: the Bayesian-EKF system significantly outperformed the threshold-based method. It achieved a 92% detection accuracy with a 3% false alarm rate, compared to 45% accuracy and 15% false alarm rate for the simpler method. Crucially, the EKF detected the anomaly in 57 seconds – substantially faster than the 90 seconds taken by the threshold-based approach.\nComparison with Existing Technologies: Traditional threshold methods are brittle – a slight sensor drift renders them ineffective. Many current industrial anomaly detection systems rely on these types of simple approaches, leaving them vulnerable to common sensor issues. The Bayesian-EKF system’s adaptive nature offers a substantial advantage.\nPracticality Demonstration: Consider an aircraft engine. A faulty sensor could lead to an engine failure and a catastrophic crash. The rapid and accurate anomaly detection provided by this system gives engineers time to diagnose the problem and take corrective action—potentially saving lives and preventing costly damage.  The ability to deploy the system on edge devices also minimizes data transmission latency, critical for real-time applications.\n5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation: How Did We Know It Worked?\nThe verification process involved comparing the perceived anomalies in the simulations against the projected anomalies from the system. In other words, we knew that the data generator purposefully introduced a fault. The model’s output was correctly flagged as an anomaly.\nTechnical Reliability: The Kalman gain constantly re-adjusts the importance each new measurement gets based on its uncertainty. Because the EKF uses a robust mathematical framework, it is resistant to slight deviations in the behavior within the expected operational range. Through rigorous stress-testing with varied drift rates and noise levels, the system consistently demonstrated reliable performance.\n6. Adding Technical Depth: Refined Insights & Future Directions\nOne key technical contribution is the hierarchical design, combining Bayesian calibration and recursive filtering. While other systems address anomaly detection, few integrate this dual approach for drift correction and state estimation. This combination directly addresses the challenge of sensor drift, a major limitation of existing anomaly detection systems.\nTo further enhance the system, future focus lies on incorporating LSTM networks. LSTMs can learn complex temporal dependencies within the data—allowing detection of anomalies that unfold over time, and potentially expanding it to a broader range of sensor types and environmental conditions.\nIn conclusion, this research provides a robust and adaptive solution for anomaly detection in extreme environments.  By combining Bayesian calibration and recursive filtering, it achieves significant improvements in accuracy, speed, and reliability. The exploration of LSTM networks and adaptive learning algorithms provides a roadmap for continued refinement and real-world deployment.\nThis document is a part of the Freederia Research Archive.

      "description": "Introduction\n\n\nIn December 2025, the global cybersecurity community’s annual flagship event, Black Hat Europe 2025, is set to kick off in London, UK. The Arsenal showcase, a key indicator of technological trends within the Black Hat series, has always been a focal point for security researchers and practitioners to gain insights into future trends. It brings together the world’s most cutting-edge open-source security tools and innovative concepts. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of 8 open-source AI security tools that will be presented at the Black Hat Europe 2025 Arsenal, helping you get an early look at their technical highlights and application scenarios.\n\nGithub link：\nhttps://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guard\nhttps://github.com/mandiant/harbinger\nhttps://github.com/stratosphereips/MIPSEval\nhttps://github.com/ErdemOzgen/RedAiRange\nhttps://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikee\nhttps://github.com/ThalesGroup/sql-data-guard\nAI-powered red team attacks are rapidly evolving from individual techniques into systematic operational capabilities. This conference showcases a “Red Team Trilogy” covering an operational platform, a training range, and a risk self-assessment tool.\nHarbinger: The AI-Powered Red Team Operations Center\n· Operational Automation: Utilizes AI to automatically execute repetitive tasks such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and lateral movement.\n· Decision Support: Based on the operational landscape, AI can recommend the optimal next attack path to red team members.\n· Automated Reporting: Automatically organizes attack logs, screenshots, and findings to generate structured attack reports, freeing red team members from tedious documentation work.\nConnecting the different components of red teaming. This project integrates multiple components commonly used and makes it easier to perform actions, output, and parse.\nFeatures\n· Neo4j: Use data from neo4j directly into templating of tool commands.\n· C2 Servers: By default we have support for Mythic. But you can bring your own integration by implementing some code, see the custom connectors documentation.\n· File parsing: Harbinger can parse a number of file types and import the data into the database. Examples include lsass dumps and ad snapshots. See the parser table for a full list.\n· Output parsing: Harbinger can detect useful information in output from the C2 and provide you easy access to it.\n· Data searching: Harbinger gives you the ability to search for data in the database in a number of ways. It combines the data from all your C2s in a single database.\n· Playbooks: Execute commands in turn in a playbook.\n· Dark mode: Do I need to say more.\n· AI integration: Harbinger uses LLMs to analyze data, extract useful information and provide suggestions to the operator for the next steps and acts as an assistant.\nHarbinger signals a shift in AI red teaming from “using AI tools” to being “driven by an AI platform.”\nRed AI Range (RAR): The Digital Dojo for AI Offense and Defense\n· Practice Real-World Attacks: Engage in hands-on practice of real-world attack techniques such as model evasion, data poisoning, and model stealing.\n· Validate Defenses: Deploy and test defensive measures against AI threats in a controlled environment.\n\nThe open-sourcing of RAR significantly lowers the barrier for enterprises and individuals to conduct AI offensive and defensive exercises.\nA.I.G: The AI Security Risk Self-Assessment Platform\n· AI Infrastructure Scanning: Accurately scans mainstream AI frameworks (like Ollama, ComfyUI) based on fingerprinting and detects known CVE vulnerabilities within them.\n· MCP Server Scanning: With the explosion in popularity of MCPs, their security has become crucial. A.I.G uses Agent technology to scan MCP Server source code or remote MCP URLs, covering nine major risk categories including tool poisoning, remote code execution, and indirect prompt injection.\nBecome a member\n\nA.I.G has the highest number of GitHub Stars (2300+) among all the tools, and its widespread popularity indicates that AI security assessment is becoming democratized. Ordinary AI developers and Agent users also need a platform that can cover the full-stack risk assessment from the underlying infrastructure to the upper-level model applications.\nAs LLMs become deeply integrated into business processes, fine-grained security assessment and access control are becoming critically important.\nSPIKEE & MIPSEval: Evaluating Single-Turn and Multi-Turn LLM Security\n\nHowever, many security issues only manifest during sustained, multi-turn conversations. The open-source tool MIPSEval fills this gap by being specifically designed to evaluate the security consistency of LLMs in long dialogues. For example, a model might refuse to answer an inappropriate question in the first turn, but after a few rounds of “priming” with unrelated conversation, its safety guardrails could be bypassed. MIPSEval, combined with multiple LLM Agents, provides a framework for evaluating this complex, stateful security.\n\nSQL Data Guard: A Secure Channel for LLM Database Access\n\nSQL is the go-to language for performing queries on databases, and for a good reason — it’s well known, easy to use, and pretty simple. However, it seems that it’s as easy to use as it is to exploit, and SQL injection is still one of the most targeted vulnerabilities — especially nowadays with the proliferation of “natural language queries” harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) power to generate and run SQL queries.To help solve this problem, we developed sql-data-guard, an open-source project designed to verify that SQL queries access only the data they are allowed to. It takes a query and a restriction configuration, and returns whether the query is allowed to run or not. Additionally, it can modify the query to ensure it complies with the restrictions. sql-data-guard has also a built-in module for detection of malicious payloads, allowing it to report on and remove malicious expressions before query execution.sql-data-guard is particularly useful when constructing SQL queries with LLMs, as such queries can’t run as prepared statements. Prepared statements secure a query’s structure, but LLM-generated queries are dynamic and lack this fixed form, increasing SQL injection risk. sql-data-guard mitigates this by inspecting and validating the query’s content.By verifying and modifying queries before they are executed, sql-data-guard helps prevent unauthorized data access and accidental data exposure. Adding sql-data-guard to your application can prevent or minimize data breaches and the impact of SQL injection attacks, ensuring that only permitted data is accessed.Connecting LLMs to SQL databases without strict controls can risk accidental data exposure, as models may generate SQL queries that access sensitive information. OWASP highlights cases of poor sandboxing leading to unauthorized disclosures, emphasizing the need for clear access controls and prompt validation. Businesses should adopt rigorous access restrictions, regular audits, and robust API security, especially to comply with privacy laws and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which penalize unauthorized data exposure.\nAI not only introduces new threats but also provides powerful assistance in solving traditional security challenges, especially in terms of scalability and efficiency improvement.\nPatch Wednesday: AI-Driven Automated Vulnerability Remediation\n· Input: Provide a CVE number and the vulnerable code repository.\n· Processing: A privately deployed LLM analyzes the CVE description, understands the root cause of the vulnerability, and analyzes it in the context of the code.\n· Output: Automatically generates a code patch to fix the vulnerability for developers to review and apply.\nThis approach promises to shorten hours or even days of manual remediation work to just a few minutes, dramatically increasing the efficiency of security response.\nOpenSource Security LLM: Democratizing Threat Modeling Capabilities\n· Assist in Threat Modeling: Automatically generate potential threat scenarios based on a system description.\n· Automate Code Review: Analyze code snippets from a security perspective to identify potential vulnerabilities.\nThis foreshadows a future where every developer and security engineer can deploy an “AI Security Assistant” locally, thereby integrating security capabilities more broadly into the early stages of the development lifecycle.\nIV. Conclusion and Outlook: Towards a Mature AI Security Ecosystem\nSystematization of AI Red Teaming and Attack Simulation: Attack tools are evolving from single-function utilities to platform-based, automated, and intelligent systems, with corresponding cyber ranges for adversarial simulation also emerging.\n\n\nRefinement of LLM Security and Governance: Assessment and defense tools for prompt injection, data security, and multi-turn conversational safety are becoming more mature, forming a critical part of governance.\n\n\nAutomation of AI-Powered Defense: AI is being deeply integrated into traditional security processes like vulnerability management and threat modeling to enhance efficiency and scalability.\n\n\n\nJust like open-source large models, open-source AI security tools will become a core driving force for innovation in the security industry. The tools featured at Black Hat will greatly promote the dissemination and iteration of cutting-edge technologies. For all security practitioners, now is a critical moment not only to learn how to “;defend against AI” but also to learn how to “leverage AI” to revolutionize existing security practices. This new arms race centered around artificial intelligence has only just begun.\nReference\nhttps://www.blackhat.com/eu-25/arsenal/schedule/index.html#track/ai-ml--data-science",

      "description": "Unleashing the Power of Sparks: Unveiling the Future of Artificial Intelligence\nAs we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology, one question remains at the forefront of our minds: what lies ahead for artificial intelligence (AI)? The pursuit of creating intelligent machines has been a dream of mathematicians, logicians, and visionaries for centuries. In his comprehensive guide, \"AI Tomorrow: Rewriting the Rules of Life, Work and Purpose,\" Malik Abualzait takes us on a journey through the history and evolution of AI, shedding light on its potential to transform our lives and societies.\nFor those interested in delving deeper into this topic, see Chapter 1 in Malik Abualzait's comprehensive guide available on Amazon. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the essence of artificial intelligence and its impact on our world.\nThe concept of machines thinking dates back to ancient Greece, where myths told of automatons – mechanical beings imbued with life. Fast-forwarding to the 20th century, the vision transformed into science. In 1950, Alan Turing posed a provocative question: \"Can machines think?\" His test, now legendary, envisioned a machine indistinguishable from a human in conversation. Just six years later, the term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined at the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, marking the birth of a new field of science.\nThe early pioneers of AI focused on developing algorithms that could learn and adapt to new situations. This led to significant breakthroughs in machine learning, enabling machines to improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every task.\nMachine learning is a key driver behind the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. By leveraging complex mathematical algorithms and large datasets, machines can learn from experience and improve their decision-making capabilities. This has far-reaching implications for various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.\nConsider the use of machine learning in medical diagnosis. A study published by Stanford University demonstrated that a neural network-based algorithm could diagnose breast cancer with an accuracy rate of 97% (1). Such breakthroughs have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery systems worldwide.\nThe Future of Work: Navigating AI's Impact\n\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, it raises questions about its impact on employment and the nature of work. While some argue that automation will lead to widespread job displacement, others see AI as a tool for augmenting human capabilities.\nMalik Abualzait discusses this topic in-depth throughout his book, highlighting the need for workers to upskill and reskill in an era where machines are increasingly capable of handling routine tasks (2). This requires a shift from traditional education systems that focus on teaching specific skills to more holistic approaches that emphasize adaptability and lifelong learning.\nCode Examples: Bringing AI to Life\n\n\nTo illustrate the power of machine learning, consider the following Python code snippet for training a simple neural network using Keras:\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))\nmodel.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)\n\nThis code demonstrates a basic neural network architecture for image classification tasks. As AI continues to advance, such examples will become increasingly relevant in various fields.\nKey Takeaways: Unlocking AI's Potential\n\n\n\n Artificial intelligence has come a long way since its inception, with significant breakthroughs in machine learning and natural language processing.\n The future of work is likely to be shaped by AI's ability to automate routine tasks, making it essential for workers to upskill and reskill.\n Machine learning algorithms have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.\nConclusion: Mastering the History and Evolution of AI\n\n\nAs we navigate the complex landscape of artificial intelligence, it is essential to understand its history and evolution.

Today, we're extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational complexity of maintaining separate gateways, while providing the same centralized tool and authentication management that existed for REST APIs and AWS Lambda functions.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04855v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.",

We introduce Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving. Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.\n  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i) large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA (TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without sacrificing baseline capability.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment: hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning, existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses, and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.",

Traditional expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles (run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting, ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision achievable.\n  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction), and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges.

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04694v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first \"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.",

A natural strategy to increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks. Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.",

This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways. Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona, supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left.",

Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04711v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics. Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason: watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04715v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.",

This paper is the first to systematically investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms, where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through visualizations such as radar charts.

To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of trustworthiness across datasets.

This work introduces a novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection.

To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.",

However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

To address this challenge, prior works have explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\\times inference speedup.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04811v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data, while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance, providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04812v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation. Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies, such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong performance, and robustness under noisy observations.

However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness.

Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.",

This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated.",

Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a 17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers, while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.",

However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04909v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

While recent advances have extended context windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length.

Existing passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.

We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model safety and creative fidelity.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04970v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry; second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new, generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs, and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04995v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.",

We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.",

However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology, we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.",

We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\\boldsymbol{\\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.",

Yet, real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements, use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.",

Existing aggregation and personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure, preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition, precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.",

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.",

The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages.

In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA.",

They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.",

While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise. Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.05179v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.",

However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously.

Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced, enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution. Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms, establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.",

Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.",

We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples.

However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?",

Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued exploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered experimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding, accessibility, and multi-modal support. A ranking task for instructional support materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations over traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture slides.\n  These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI concepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.05385v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.

      "description": "arXiv:2511.05396v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.",

In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\\%. Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads, leading to a speed up of 59.63\\%-93.27\\% compared to Path Patching applied to the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar performance to previously established Path Patching circuits",

Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce.

However, prevailing definitions and therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI literacy for real-world job use.

We describe the development of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past research or developed ourselves.

Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance.

However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU.

In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to \"go wider\" by expanding new candidate responses or \"go deeper\" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

      "description": "arXiv:2509.18883v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.21993v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.",

Existing systems differ in their abstractions, data flow semantics, and tool integrations, making it difficult to share or reproduce workflows. We introduce Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec), a declarative language that defines AI agents and agentic workflows in a way that is compatible across frameworks, promoting reusability, portability and interoperability of AI agents. Agent Spec defines a common set of components, control and data flow semantics, and schemas that allow an agent to be defined once and executed across different runtimes. Agent Spec also introduces a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks. We demonstrate this using four distinct runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow) evaluated over three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $\\tau^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL). We provide accompanying toolsets: a Python SDK (PyAgentSpec), a reference runtime (WayFlow), and adapters for popular frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI). Agent Spec bridges the gap between model-centric and agent-centric standardization & evaluation, laying the groundwork for reliable, reusable, and portable agentic systems.",

While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.",

While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), which rethinks human reasoning simulation along three dimensions: (i) from averaged to individualized reasoning, (ii) from behavioral mimicry to cognitive alignment, and (iii) from vignette-based to open-ended data. The benchmark evaluates whether a model can predict a specific person's behavioral responses and the underlying reasoning dynamics in out-of-distribution scenarios, given partial evidence of their prior views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a human track that automates and scales the think-aloud method to collect ecologically valid human reasoning data, and a synthetic track for further scalability and systematic stress testing. This architecture enables low-cost, extensible expansion to new tasks and populations. Experiments with state-of-the-art language models reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. The benchmark, along with its complete data collection pipeline and companion chatbot, is open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.21150v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.",

However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools.

Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper, we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop. Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.",

      "description": "arXiv:2510.26854v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.",

Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.

We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences (from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins and refines future monitoring through verification feedback.

The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.",

Due to low aggregation, the electricity demands can be highly stochastic and point estimates would lead to inflated errors. Interval estimation in this scenario, would provide a range of values within which the future values might lie and helps quantify the errors around the point estimates. This paper introduces a residual bootstrap algorithm to generate interval estimates of day-ahead electricity demand. A machine learning algorithm is used to obtain the point estimates of electricity demand and respective residuals on the training set. The obtained residuals are stored in memory and the memory is further partitioned. Days with similar demand patterns are grouped in clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm and these clusters are used to partition the memory. The point estimates for test day are used to find the closest cluster of similar days and the residuals are bootstrapped from the chosen cluster. This algorithm is evaluated on the real electricity demand data from EULR(End Use Load Research) and is compared to other bootstrapping methods for varying confidence intervals.",

To address this, we propose a novel Fundus On-the-fly Test-Time Adaptation (FunOTTA) framework that effectively generalizes a fundus image diagnosis model to unseen environments, even under strong domain shifts. FunOTTA stands out for its stable adaptation process by performing dynamic disambiguation in the memory bank while minimizing harmful prior knowledge bias. We also introduce a new training objective during adaptation that enables the classifier to incrementally adapt to target patterns with reliable class conditional estimation and consistency regularization. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) pipelines. Experiments on cross-domain fundus image benchmarks across two diseases demonstrate the superiority of the overall framework and individual components under different backbone networks.

      "description": "arXiv:2409.01083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.",

However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.",

To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination.

To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval.

Traditional approaches often require extensive domain expertise and feature engineering. While large language models, with their vast scientific knowledge, circumvent the feature engineering limitations, they lack the calibrated uncertainty estimates required for high-stakes decision making. Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, a cornerstone of pharmaceutical synthesis, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-yielding reaction conditions, from 24% to 43% in 50 experimental iterations starting from 10 unsuccessful conditions. Across 19 diverse optimization problems spanning organic synthesis, materials science and catalysis, process chemistry, and molecular design, our approach ranks first on average, establishing a new paradigm for reliable, uncertainty-guided optimization with LLMs. Our approach can accelerate discovery by lowering the barrier to using powerful optimization methods, replacing the need for domain-specific feature engineering with more accessible natural language interfaces.

However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel approach that exploits these unique patterns to break the security and alignment constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection.

In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy.

The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on four domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.",

These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability.

      "description": "arXiv:2506.05583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning models with uncertainty quantification, offering formal coverage guarantees under exchangeable data. However, these guarantees fail when faced with subpopulation shifts, where the test environment contains a different mix of subpopulations than the calibration data. In this work, we focus on unknown subpopulation shifts where we are not given group-information i.e. the subpopulation labels of datapoints have to be inferred. We propose new methods that provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage without explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. While existing methods in similar setups assume perfect subpopulation labels, our framework explicitly relaxes this requirement and characterizes conditions where formal coverage guarantees remain feasible. Further, our algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings and remain practical in realistic machine learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods reliably maintain coverage and effectively control risks in scenarios where standard conformal prediction fails.",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach -- performed via quantile regression -- that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \\emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.",

      "description": "arXiv:2506.16471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step; rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \\(10\\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior knowledge, and can correct this knowledge when contradicted by data. Finally, LGES can use interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.",

In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.",

Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models.

This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.",

To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics.

Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort.

In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses.

Data-driven approaches using deep learning models show promise but critically depend on the availability of large, accurately labeled datasets. Yet existing datasets either suffer from noisy labels, limited range of vulnerabilities, or fail to reflect vulnerabilities as they occur in real-world software. This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to directly address these dataset limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success rates. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection workflow. It automatically injects realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities for high-fidelity, diverse, large-scale vulnerability dataset generation. Unlike prior monolithic approaches, AVIATOR orchestrates specialized AI agents, function agents and traditional code analysis tools that replicate expert reasoning. It combines semantic analysis, injection synthesis enhanced with LoRA-based fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as well as post-injection validation via static analysis and LLM-based discriminators. This modular decomposition allows specialized agents to focus on distinct tasks, improving robustness of injection and reducing error propagation across the workflow. Evaluations across three distinct benchmarks demonstrate that AVIATOR achieves 91%-95% injection success rates, significantly surpassing existing automated dataset generation techniques in both accuracy and scope of software vulnerabilities.",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.03505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

      "description": "arXiv:2509.18116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive inference costs--techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step verification can require $10-100\\times$ more compute per query than standard decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks, ALS achieves $2-5\\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment.

Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people.

Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.",

Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions.

We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.",

However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively.

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact.

Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.076 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.",

Since ADM regulation faces geopolitical headwinds, effective governance will have to rely at least in part on the enforcement of existing laws. Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participant's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the Australian legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter. The paper is relevant to law and technology scholars; individuals and groups harmed by ADM; public interest litigators and technology lawyers; civil society and advocacy organisations; and policymakers.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.03891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.",

      "description": "arXiv:2511.04247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.",

      "description": "Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were indicted in Brooklyn on charges that they conspired to illegally rig bets on pitches thrown during games. The two were charged with wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy, among other things. \nAccording to the indictment:\nThe defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types and speeds of pitches, and their co-conspirators used that inside information to place wagers on those pitches. In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments-funneled through third parties-in exchange for rigging pitches.\nThe scheme involved unnamed third-party bettors who allegedly earned over $400,000 on bets involving Clase and Ortiz. The pitchers, for their part, received kickbacks according to the indictment. In some instances, Clase and Ortiz even provided their coconspirators with money to fund the bets. \nTo organize the scheme, the two used their cellphones during games, which is prohibited by the MLB except under extenuating circumstances. The two are also facing a potential lifetime ban from the sport for violating the league’s rules against betting on their own games. \nHowever, if convicted, it’s unlikely they’d be released from prison while still young enough to compete anyway. Clase and Ortiz are facing a possible sentence of up to 65 years.",

      "description": "Do the ornaments you adorn your Christmas tree with reflect you or your family’s interests? If not, maybe you should rectify that. We recently went hands on with Hallmark’s realistic Xbox 360 replica ornament, which plays a snippet of audio from Halo 3. As it turns out, there are many other ornaments available that are specifically designed to evoke nostalgia and make us open our wallets (surprise, surprise). In fact, did you know that the company also makes a CRT monitor with The Oregon Trail displayed on it? It’s rad.\nEven if video games aren’t your jam, Hallmark has a stranglehold on the intersection of ornaments and entertainment, with numerous options covering your favorite TV shows, movies, or favorite brands (maybe your household is the type that’d proudly display a mac and cheese ornament, maybe not). We’ve included some of our favorites below, and even if you aren’t necessarily the target audience, they’d make for a great gift. We even threw in some non-Hallmark options, because why not?\nRetro Tech Glass Holiday Ornament – VHS Tape\nYou can almost smell the mustiness of your local video store — that is, assuming you still have one.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24 at MoMA Store\n $24 at Love and Victory\n\nNintendo Entertainment System Console Ornament\nNintendo’s first home gaming console in the US, immortalized as a replica ornament.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24.99 at Hallmark\n $24.99 at Amazon\n\nXbox 360 Console Ornament\nA replica that gets all of the details right, except for portraying the Xbox Red Ring of Death.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $28.99 at Amazon\n $28.99 at Hallmark\n\nRecord Crate Ornament\nA throwback to the record-filled milk crates you once had, or perhaps the collection you’re just now building.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24 at Love and Victory\n\nSuper Mario Super Star Topper\nWhether you’re into gaming or not, the Super Star topper is a cute alternative for the star you have.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $92.99 at Hallmark\n $92.99 at Amazon\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day – T1000 Ornament\nThe shape-shifting T1000 android is an ornament I didn’t know I’d want this year.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $28.99 at Hallmark\n $28.99 at Amazon\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Into the Carbon-Freezing Chamber\nThis elaborate ornament depicts the scene from The Empire Strikes Back when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.

      "description": "As a tech parent I think one of the best things I did for both my son and daughter was for their first computer to help them to build and setup their own Linux computer (It was Ubuntu back then but they’ve both moved themselves to Arch these days).\nWe went together and bought a second hand desktop (exciting the people selling to us also) and when I got home I pulled out the Ram, HD and CD drive and set them aside; and then together with a screwdriver we “built the computer” over a few days.\nIn windows when a child goes searching the web for a “movie maker for windows” they are going to be in a world of hurt either finding expensive commercial options or super scammy sites promising the world.\nBy comparison on Linux if they search the local “app store” they’ll find stacks and stacks of free, useful, open licensed software.\nMy kids loved the power, freedom and later unexpected community this bought them.\nNow my friend wants the same for their daughter who is 8 years old.\nI’m planning to do the same and go with her parents and her and buy a second hand desktop together and then put Linux on it.\nMy question is where would you go from there? What suggestions do you have? What to install? Any mini “curriculums” or ideas?\nWould love to hear your ideas and experiences. Linux with free and open software is the goal and focus.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45864732\nPoints: 188\n# Comments: 236",

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds",
      "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $228 at Amazon\n $329.99 $228 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $89 at Nothing\n $109 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)\nThe second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExceptional ANC\nSecure fit\nWireless charging case\n\nBulky design\nMerely average battery life\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Bose\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\nRead our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah! Wireless charging!\nAdds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio\nSlimmer ear hook, smaller case\nAdds heart rate\nGreat sound\nNo price hike\n\nCase is still a chonker\nHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features last year. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, in combination with better ANC performance, give the AirPods Pro 3 the best overall noise canceling from a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is incredibly close to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (although some people might not even notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, which we first saw with the Powerbeats Pro 2 last winter, enables heart rate tracking for 50 different types of workouts directly from the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. \nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $169 at Amazon\n $229 $169 at Best Buy\n $229 $169 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $149.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $149.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $299.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $299.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to add the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) and Apple AirPods Pro 3 as picks, and to reflect current pricing / availability.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech",
      "description": "For anyone working in today’s rapidly evolving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, visibility, authenticity, and connection are no longer optional; they are essential. But there is a lack of resources for STEM professionals, especially women, looking to express themselves fully, build meaningful networks, and lead with confidence.\nTo help, IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) recently launched a podcast series in which experts from around the world inspire and inform to ignite change.\nThe series aims to amplify the diverse experiences of women from STEM fields. Through candid conversations and expert insights, the podcast goes beyond technical talks to explore the human side of innovation, navigating burnout, balancing career ambition with well-being, and building successful, sustainable careers.\nThe series is a volunteer and staff-run initiative.\n“In the early days of planning, our vision was just a spark shared among passionate volunteers eager to shape each episode and guest experience,” says Geetika Tandon, cochair of the IEEE WIE podcast subcommittee. “Seeing our podcast grow from those first conversations into a vibrant reality has been truly rewarding. We can’t wait for it to expand further.”\n“I’m excited that we’ve brought the drawings on our whiteboard and day planners to life,” says Kelly Onu, who is also cochair.\nNew episodes are released on the third Wednesday of each month.\nNavigating dual-career dynamics\nThe podcast’s premier episode, “Moms Who Innovate,” which debuted in May, features candid conversations with two executive coaches, authors, and TEDx speakers. Adaeze Iloeje-Udeogalanya, is the founder of African Women in STEM, which provides education, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Cassie Leonard is a seasoned aerospace professional who founded ELMM Coaching. Leonard offers one-on-one advice for professionals looking to grow their career and achieve a better work-life balance. She authored STEM Moms: Design, Build, and Test to Create the Work-Life of Your Dreams, a book that guides women by drawing from her experiences as a working mother.\nOnu, who moderated the episode, spoke with Iloeje-Udeogalanya and Leonard about the ebb and flow of being a mother while building a career. Both guests described how their background as engineers shaped the way they approach motherhood and community. They emphasized the importance of creating a support system that makes the busier times of life more manageable.\nLeonard said she “engineered her neighborhood” and shares the responsibilities of dropping off children at school, babysitting after school, and other day-to-day tasks.\n“As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.” —Geetika Tandon\nInnovation for moms isn’t only about professional success, the duo said, but also about designing the kind of community that helps them thrive.\nThe June episode, “Global Perspectives on Women in STEM,” led by Tandon, offered practical strategies for navigating work-life-balance challenges. Together with guest Sanyogita Shamsunder, CTO of telecommunications company GeoLinks in San Francisco, Tandon explored different perspectives of women around the world.\nRawan Alghamdi, a wireless communication researcher at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, in Saudi Arabia, and an IEEE graduate student member hosted August’s episode, “PIE Framework: Presence, Image, and Exposure for Professionals in STEM.” Alghamdi spoke with Jahnavi Brenner, an executive coach and former engineer, who explained the PIE model, which challenges the long-held belief that technical skills alone are enough to advance one’s career.\nBrenner said professionals must strategically build an authentic personal brand to dictate how they are perceived by colleagues and how visible they are within their networks and industry. She said it is especially vital for women and underrepresented groups, who often face systemic barriers to recognition and promotion.\nOctober’s episode, “Balancing Work and Life in STEM Careers,” tackled struggles parents face raising a family while working full time. It was moderated by Abinaya Inbamani, a mentor who has contributed to the successful deployment of IoT systems used for smart health care, renewable energy, and cybersecurity.\nShe covered the intense logistics and emotional toll of balancing a demanding career with the responsibilities of parenthood.\nListeners also learned time-management strategies and boundary-setting techniques, such as reframing guilt as a reminder of care and responsibility rather than failure; accepting that it’s all right to procrastinate occasionally rather than push through unhealthy stress; and organizing the day with clear boundaries between work and home.\n“We don’t have to do it all,” Inbamani said. “Sometimes balance is simply choosing what matters most in that moment.” \nWhat’s next for the podcast\nUpcoming episodes will focus on being present parents, setting boundaries in high-pressure environments, and redefining success on one’s own terms, Tandon and Onu say.\nIn the works is an episode spotlighting tech trailblazer Nimisha Morkonda Gnanasekaran, who was recognized by the IEEE Computer Society as one of its Top 30 Early Career Professionals this year. She is the director of data science and advanced analytics at Western Digital, based in San Jose, Calif.\nAnother episode, Tandon and Onu say, will feature a conversation with Cynthia Kane, author of The Pause Principle: How to Keep Your Cool in Tough Situations, on navigating difficult workplace conversations without shutting down or losing one’s temper. The episode will tackle critical issues and career struggles women face, Tandon and Onu say. A study that found as many as 50 percent of women leave their STEM career within five years.\nGlobal reach and impact of the podcast\nIEEE WIE is seeing the impact the podcast is having on listeners. Several say they tune in not just for advice but also to connect with others. Others say the podcast makes them feel they are not alone in their challenges or career aspirations.\nThe majority of listeners are in Canada, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the United States. Onu says she hopes the audience expands to include more countries.\n“I hope this podcast hops across continents, sneaks into earbuds everywhere, and becomes a trusty sidekick in women’s STEM journeys—cheering them on as they conquer equations, break barriers, and maybe even invent a robot that makes perfect coffee,” Tandon says. “As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.”\nThrough personal tales, inspiring journeys, and a parade of trailblazing leaders who have tackled obstacles, IEEE WIE is celebrating the grit, wit, and brilliance of women in STEM.\nWhether you’re a student just beginning your STEM journey, a mid-career professional seeking clarity, or a leader looking to give back to your profession, the podcast offers a space to learn, reflect, and rise together.",

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nUnlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.\n\n[ HiPeR Lab ]\n\nI appreciate the softness of NEO’s design, but those fingers look awfully fragile.\n\n[ 1X ]\n\nImagine reaching into your backpack to find your keys. Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn’t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.\n\nMulti-university Collaboration presented via [ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nHappy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!\n\n[ Pollen Robotics ]\n\nIn collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling worm robot to test in the field. See it crawls through corrugated drainage pipes in a stream, and a smooth section of a subsurface drainage system.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Smart Microsystems Laboratory, Michigan State University ]\n\nHeterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments — uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps — subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.\n\n[ SPINE-HT ] from [ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania ]\n\nAstribot keeping itself busy at IROS 2025.\n\n[ Astribot ]\n\nIn two papers published in Matter and Advanced Science, a team of scientists from the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, developed control strategies for influencing the motion of self-propelling oil droplets. These oil droplets mimic single-celled microorganisms and can autonomously solve a complex maze by following chemical gradients. However, it is very challenging to integrate external perturbation and use these droplets in robotics. To address these challenges, the team developed magnetic droplets that still possess life-like properties and can be controlled by external magnetic fields. In their work, the researchers showed that they are able to guide the droplet’s motion and use them in microrobotic applications such as cargo transportation.\n\n[ Max Planck Institute ]\n\nEveryone has fantasized about having an embodied avatar!

Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Autonomous Robots Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology ]\n\nHeavy payloads are no problem for it: The new KR TITAN ultra moves payloads of up to 1500 kg, making the heavy lifting extreme in the KUKA portfolio.\n\n[ Kuka ]\n\nGood luck getting all of the sand out of that robot.

As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks?

      "title": "Co-Captain Allows Ships to Share Important Navigational Data",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ship-navigation-orca-ai",
      "description": "A new onboard system allows ocean-going vessels to share real-time sea condition data, giving crews early warnings and helping them navigate more safely. The system will analyze data related to navigation, vessel behavior, and the environment to give ship crews guidance at sea.\nWhile casualties from ship collisions and groundings have declined, the overall number of maritime incidents are on the rise, up 22 percent in recent years, driven by aging vessels and equipment failures.\nOrca AI, a London-based autonomous maritime navigation company, has introduced a software feature called Co-Captain, aiming to reduce those incidents. Co-Captain is an addition to the company’s existing SeaPod real-time decision support system, which bridge officers can use while at sea to navigate better.\n  Co-Captain provides information about severe weather, including recommendations to specific ships based on their size and shape.Orca AI\n“Co-Captain is a network of vessels using Orca to capture events worldwide and share insights. Think of it like the navigation app you use in your car: it tells you about traffic or roadblocks in advance so you can adjust your route,” says Yarden Gross, the CEO and co-founder of Orca AI.\nGross says that Co-Captain frequently collects data from sensors on board vessels and sends it to the cloud to improve ship performance and safety for vessels globally.\nOrca AI’s Maritime Solutions\nOrcaAI, founded in 2018 by Gross and Dor Raviv, the CTO, began with SeaPod and Fleet View. While SeaPod collects and analyzes data on individual ships, Fleet View gathers that data in the cloud to give fleet managers on shore better visibility into larger operations.\nCo-Captain integrates with the existing system to provide proactive insights to improve fleet performance and safety. Today, ship officers rely on tools like radar, the automatic identification system (AIS), and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) monitor the positions of other vessels and avoid collisions, but much of the work remains manual.\n  Co-Captain identifies various navigational hazards to a ship’s crew. The crew can also manually tag obstacles or other concerns.Orca AI\nGross described Co-Captain as the next generation of AIS, the network that transmits basic information like a ship’s position, name, and heading over very high frequency (VHF) signals ranging from 30 to 300 megahertz. Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship’s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels’ crews.\n“Every ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node—the vessel itself—has an onboard AI platform. This platform collects data from multiple sensors in real time,” Gross says. Using cameras and computer vision, the AI model can detect bad weather, low visibility, tall waves, or strong winds, then the platform analyzes the data to provide tailored guidance.\nAll data is anonymized. Gross says that a ship’s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. “By anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.”\nGross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.\nThe company’s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship’s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations. The platform is already in use on over 1,200 vessels.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/evs-keep-homes-lit",
      "description": "In Menifee, Calif., six newly built homes are testing a first for North America: electric vehicles that can power houses through the Combined Charging System (CCS) high-power DC charging standard. Each home uses a host Kia EV9 electric vehicle connected to a Wallbox Quasar 2 bidirectional charger, allowing the car’s 100-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery to run essential circuits during blackouts or periods when electricity prices are high. The setup is the first residential vehicle-to-home (V2H) system in the United States that uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. The CCS is the charging system commonly used in European and North American residential and public charging facilities.\nSince July, the homes’ smart electrical panels have automatically managed two-way power flow—charging vehicles from the grid or rooftop solar, then reversing the flow of energy when needed. The system isolates each home from the grid during an outage, preventing any current from flowing into external power lines and endangering utility crews and nearby equipment.\n“This project is demonstrating that bidirectional charging with CCS can work in occupied homes,” says Scott Samuelsen, founding director of the Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP) at the University of California, Irvine, which is monitoring the two-year trial. “It’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people but also strengthen the energy system.”\nMenifee means a lot\nFor more than a decade, two-way charging has been available—but mostly restricted to Japan. Back in 2012 the Nissan’s LEAF-to-Home program proved the idea viable after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but that Nissan system relied on the CHAdeMO standard, little used outside of Japan. Most North American and European manufacturers chose CCS instead—a standard that, until recently, supported only one-way fast DC charging.\nThat distinction makes Menifee’s V2H-enabled neighborhood notable: it’s the first CCS-based V2H deployment in occupied homes, giving researchers real-world field data on a technology that’s been long trapped in pilot programs. The pairing of the Kia EV9 SUV with Wallbox’s commercially available Quasar 2 can deliver up to 12 kilowatts of power from the vehicle to the home.\nIt’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people, but also strengthen the energy system.”\n –Scott Samuelsen, UC Irvine\n\nElsewhere, momentum towards commercial V2H has slowed. Ford’s F-150 Lightning supports home backup through Sunrun, but Sunrun equipment is not CCS-compatible. What’s more, Ford has announced a production pause for the pickup truck, which has delayed expansion. GM’s Ultium Home—a  V2H system that works with the automaker’s Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra EVs— faces similar setbacks. Tesla’s PowerShare V2H feature is still stuck in a limited, early commercial rollout, with bidirectional compatibility restricted to the company’s Cybertruck. Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.\nWhy CCS Matters\nWhen electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).\nBidirectional operation wasn’t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS’s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations—ISO 15118—didn’t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, ISO 15118-20, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.\nWallbox’s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its 12-kW power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says Aleix Maixé Sas, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.\n  As the company’s name humbly suggests, Wallbox’s chargers look like plain old boxes—although they contain high-tech components.Wallbox\nThe Menifee blueprint\nEach of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh SunVault stationary battery from SunPower. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9’s battery. When the grid fails—or when energy prices spike—the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.\nThis past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that “the vehicle adds a major resilience feature,” according to Samuelsen, who is the Menifee project manager. “It can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.”\nEngineering the Two-Way Home\nHome builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.\nA Glimpse of the Energy Future\nAnalysts expect double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee’s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.\nWhen EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear—and with it, old concepts regarding who’s an energy supplier and who’s a customer.",

Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free!\nAt its core, engineering is an act of creation. This is why many of us chose to become engineers: We love to build things.\nBut especially if you have a private sector job, it’s easy to forget that passion to build as you climb up the corporate ladder. Somewhere between quarterly planning meetings and incident retrospectives, we often lose the joy of creation in our corporate jobs. Large companies require a level of bureaucracy and specialization that is often at odds with building something new.\nThat’s why I frequently recommend burned-out engineers to do something very simple: Start a side project. During 15 years working across various tech stacks and companies, this has been the most straightforward, underrated, and powerful way to regain my excitement at work.\nBeyond rekindling a passion for creation, side projects have many other benefits. Side projects let us explore new technologies or problem spaces. We can leverage newer ideas that our companies may be hesitant to adopt. And you don’t need to get buy-in from a manager or explain the business justification. Start using a technology simply because you want to learn about it. \nWhen you build something through a side project, your depth of understanding is far greater than just following a tutorial or reading about it. I can attribute many of my career opportunities to the projects I’ve built and published outside of my day job. Some of these projects, like my career growth platform Taro, even turn into companies!\nWe’ve entered the golden age for side projects because they’re so much more accessible. Compared to a decade ago, it’s significantly easier to research, build, and deploy your creation. Even compared to two years ago, you’re much less likely now to waste hours wrestling with some configuration rabbit hole. Just ask ChatGPT or Gemini for help!\nThe benefits of a personal project are real: passion, learning, career growth, and fun. And they’re easier than ever to create. Now’s the time to create your side project portfolio.\n—Rahul\nHow to Land a Job in Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry is growing, opening up new opportunities for engineers—and you don’t necessarily need a background in quantum physics to take these positions. So what skills do you need?

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud",
      "description": "Have you received a notification from your bank or credit card company alerting you to suspicious activity on your account and requesting you confirm a purchase? You probably wondered how the bank suspected the charge wasn’t legitimate.\nCredit card companies use a variety of methods to detect fraud, which is the most common type of identity theft and is on the rise, according to Experian, one of the major consumer credit information services.\nPankaj Gupta\n\nEmployer \nDiscover, in Raleigh, N.C.\nTitle \nData engineering manager\nMember grade \nSenior member\nAlma mater \nChristian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India\nTo help prevent unauthorized transactions, IEEE Senior Member Pankaj Gupta is developing tools using data integration, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time account monitoring. Gupta is a manager of data and analytics engineering for Discover, and he works from Raleigh, N.C.\n“The innovations my fraud department has developed have helped my organization respond to threats faster and adapt more easily to future needs,” he says.\nThis year, he received Discover’s President’s Award, the company’s highest employee recognition. It is given to those who have achieved outstanding business results while demonstrating the company’s values.\nGupta also became an invited member of the Forbes Technology Council, a community of experienced leaders across industries, selected based on their professional achievements and leadership experience.\nHe says he enjoys his job but says he never meant to work in financial services, a field where he has built a nearly two-decade-long career.\nFrom electrical engineering to software development\nAs a youngster, he was curious about how things worked and would take apart gadgets his father brought home.\n“My father worked at BSNL, a government telecom organization, and often took me to his office,” Gupta says. “There I would watch phones in operation and telecom operators connecting trunk calls. At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.”\nWhile at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.\nTaking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.\n“Growing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the Bamleshwari Temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,” he says.\nHe also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory’s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.\n“I noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,” he says. “This exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.”\nIn 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the Christian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.\nIn India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company Satyam Computer Services, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor’s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.\nThat’s when he pivoted to software engineering.\nGupta says that although software development wasn’t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.\nHe still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn’t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.\nHis time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.\n“It’s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,” he says.\nUsing AI and machine learning to combat fraud\nGupta left Satyam in 2011 to join Mphasis, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for Wipro Technologies in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.\nHe moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at JPMorgan Chase in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank’s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.\n“This greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,” he says.\nHe also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.\n“I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.”\n“This allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,” he says. “These innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.”\nHe joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.\nAI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer’s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.\nIn simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.\nStaying connected to tech pros\nGupta joined IEEE in 2023 “to connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,” he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.\n“Membership has helped me access world-class research through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library,” he says. “It also provided me an opportunity to attend conferences and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.”\nAI’s impact on engineering\nHis advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.\n“Technology is changing very rapidly,” he says. “What is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.”\nHe predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.\n“Engineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,” he says. “I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\n“Focus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.\n“Build your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.”",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5.

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity.

      "description": "This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore.\nFish are able to dart quickly through the water and turn on a dime with a flick of their tail. Researchers have been trying to achieve similar results with aquatic robots. In fact, one group in China has made progress using a flexible electromagnetic fin that propels an underwater robot at 405 millimeters—or 1.66 body lengths—per second. The team’s robotic swimmer can also make turns over just a 0.86 body-length radius.\nFanghao Zhou, an assistant professor at the State Key Laboratory of Ocean Sensing at Zhejiang University in Zhejiang, China, helped guide the research. Zhou notes that fish are agile, efficient, and adaptive—and robotically mimicking these qualities is a challenge.\n“Traditional robotic fins powered by motors can generate strong thrust, but they’re often bulky and rigid,” he says. “Soft actuators, on the other hand, are flexible but usually too weak to be practical. Our goal was to combine the best of both fields—a compact actuator that’s powerful yet flexible, like real muscle.”\nMaking a New Kind of Fin\nSo the research team designed a flexible electromagnetic fin with an elastic joint that swishes back and forth with little friction. It’s built with two small coils and spherical magnets. When alternating current flows through the coils, it creates an oscillating magnetic field that makes the fin flap back and forth, much like a fish’s tail. When the magnetic field isn’t oscillating, the fin returns to a neutral position at rest. \nIn their study, the researchers tested their bionic fin in a pool. Zhe Wang, a Ph.D. student in Zhou’s lab, emphasizes that the team not only successfully piloted the bionic fin in water, but they also built a mathematical model connecting electrical input to hydrodynamic thrust output. “That means we can predict how the fin will behave underwater just from the input current, which is rare in soft robotics,” he says. \n  A new robotic fish design reveals different swimming behaviors at different fin oscillation speeds.  Zhe Wang et al. \nIn their experiments, the researchers used a high-speed camera and precision force sensor to measure the trajectory of the fin and the thrust it generated—achieving a peak thrust of 0.493 newtons, despite the fin weighing just 17 grams. \nZhou notes the robotic system is small, lightweight, and powerful, and it will also be easy to scale into multi-fin systems. However, he adds that the current design consumes a lot of energy. “The electromagnetic coils draw a lot of current, so the swimming duration is relatively short,” he explains. “We are exploring ways to reduce energy loss, for example [by] optimizing coil geometry, using energy recovery circuits, and applying smart control strategies that don’t require continuous excitation.”\nThe researchers anticipate this robotic system could have a range of applications, including perhaps in underwater exploration, ecological monitoring, and inspection—such as safely interacting with coral reefs and marine life.\n“Our next step is to study multi-fin coordinated motion, enabling the robot to perform more flexible and lifelike swimming behaviors,” Wang says. “We are also exploring ways to improve energy efficiency, extend operation time, and further miniaturize the system for small autonomous underwater platforms.”\nThe researchers’ bionic fin is described in a study published 4 September in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.",

      "description": "It’s a little after 6:30 on a brisk July morning in a stone hut high in the Italian Alps. A gently hissing wood fire is leaking some warmth out of a brick oven. Gathered near it, around a big wooden table, some of Europe’s brightest young lepidopterists are doing what they do best: arguing in Spanish, Italian, and English about moths.\n The Alte Pforzheimer Hütte, a stone house originally built in 1901, served as a base camp for the lepidopterists hunting rare moths in the Italian Alps.Luigi Avantaggiato\nScattered across the top of the table are dozens of moths in plastic specimen jars, the harvest of the previous night’s trapping. At one end of the table, Gioele Moro of the Czech Academy of Sciences is gently prying loose moths from the depths of a trap. At the other end, Laura Torrado-Blanco of the University of Oviedo’s entomological collection is paging through Lepidoptera guide books. She’s using the books to identify species—up here at 2,300 meters, there is no Internet connection.\n A few of the scores of moths captured on a single night at a site in the Italian Alps are lined up on a bench in the stone hut. Researchers will identify the moths’ species and some of the insects will be sent on for tissue sampling and eventual genome sequencing. Luigi Avantaggiato\nLooking up from a book, she notices me noticing the big butterfly tattoo on her left arm. “Chapman’s ringlet,” she tells me. “Erebia palarica,” she adds reflexively.\nPep Lancho Silva, a doctoral student at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, extends a finger toward me with a spectacular creature on it: a large bone-white moth, with a black head and big black splotches on its wings. Torrado-Blanco is pretty sure it’s Arctia flavia, a species of tiger moth found only in rarefied air. If so, it’s precisely the kind of insect they came up here, to this chilly hut on the edge of a crystalline Alpine pond, to capture.\n A yellow tiger moth, Arctia flavia, is among the catch at the stone hut, at an altitude of 2,300 meters. \n At the crack of dawn in the stone hut, researchers [from left] Eric Toro Delgado, Laura Torrado-Blanco, Mónica Doblas-Bajo, and Gioele Moro (standing) unpack and examine the moths captured during the previous night.Luigi Avantaggiato\nLepidopterists have trapped, identified, and classified moths and butterflies for centuries. But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It’s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of Project Psyche, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. Psyche is part of a larger effort, the Darwin Tree of Life project, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the Earth BioGenome Project. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of all of Earth’s roughly 1.8 million organisms—every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that’s made up of cells that have a nucleus.\nRelated: The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything\nNone of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it’s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal—to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035—won’t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.\n\n\n\nBut the project’s success may ultimately hinge on functions other than sequencing. For example, after a creature’s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data—consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs—must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, before an organism’s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it’s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.\nHow Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? \nWhen I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to Charlotte Wright and Joana Meier at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, England. The reasons, they tell me, span a range from pure science to completely commercial.\n \n At the Hotel Tyrol in the Italian Alps, lepidopterist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, dissects the yellow tiger moth captured near the stone hut. Packed with liquid nitrogen, the tissue samples will subsequently be sent to the institute in England for genome sequencing.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe earliest Lepidoptera appeared 250 million to 300 million years ago. By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, “we can find out how they have evolved and how they’ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.”\nThose genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell’s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature’s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the Atlas blue butterfly, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.\nThe Atlas blue is “a very good example of something that’s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,” says Meier. “What we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications”—thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. “Then we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, ‘What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that’s broken?’ ”\n Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.Luigi Avantaggiato\nAnd it’s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data. One practical aspect of these studies has to do with moths’ impact on agriculture. “There’s billions and billions of euros lost because agriculturally, some species do a lot of damage,” says Meier.\nAdds Wright, “Pests are moving to new regions where previously they weren’t present and causing huge losses because the crops there haven’t been developed to be protected against these new species.” The reasons why some species succeed in a new area as climate changes, and are able to adapt and thrive, are also understandable only by studying many genomes—of the creatures that succeed, as well as the ones that don’t. “It’s kind of a dynamic situation, of monitoring these pests’ movements,” says Wright.\n  Shortly before sunset, Gioele Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, sets up a moth trap on a mountain slope above the stone hut (the Alte Pforzheimer Hütte) in the Italian Alps.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \nThat, it turns out, takes a small army of grad students, researchers, and even citizen-scientists. Indeed, one of the goals of this expedition is to develop and refine best practices in collecting samples for genome sequencing and to train a cadre of young lepidopterists, who have varying levels of familiarity with the technologies of genome sequencing and annotation. On such techniques rests the success of not only Project Psyche, but also, ultimately, the Earth BioGenome Project.\nTo Catch a Moth, You’ve Got to Think Like One\nIt’s late in the afternoon of our first day in the high-altitude hut. Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, is standing on a steeply raked mountainside in a dazzling sea of wildflowers—purple, yellow, lavender, crimson—that are gently swaying in the fading amber light. He’s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he’s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it’s black). He’s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth’s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.\nThe objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different “microenvironments,” he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there’s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.\n  Genetics researcher Noé Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \n“Over there”—he points across the valley to the opposite slope. “It faces north. See? No flowers. That’s what I mean by different microenvironments.” We’re perched on the south-facing slope, about 80 meters above the valley bottom, on a trail about as wide as a toaster oven.\nHours later, after dodging cow patties the size of dinner plates and gaping holes leading to marmot burrows, the locations are chosen and the traps are set. There’s one on the south slope, one on the north, and one near the fast-flowing stream between them. As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.\nAt the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night’s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they’ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The Wellcome Trust is the lead sponsor of both Project Psyche and the Darwin Tree of Life project.\n \n  Lepidopterist Joana Meier of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, packs the abdomen of a moth into a vial for shipment from Italy to the institute in England. A bar code on the vial contains information about the sample and allows it to be tracked on its journey to the lab. Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe plastic tubes are packed in liquid-nitrogen-cooled shipping containers for the trip to Wellcome Sanger. DNA begins to break down almost immediately after death, especially in soft tissues. So the cryogenics are necessary to ensure that the samples arrive at Wellcome Sanger with as little degradation as possible.\nMicromoths Are a Looming Challenge \nNiklas Wahlberg of Lund University, in Sweden, is officially a “sampling hub leader” of Project Psyche. Unofficially, he’s one of the select few grizzled veterans here in Malles Venosta helping to mentor the young researchers, whose attendance is being funded through a European Union program called European Cooperation in Science and Technology.\n  Niklas Wahlberg, an evolutionary biologist at Lund University in Sweden, captures a moth in a plastic container at a trapping site along an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nWahlberg is an unabashed fan of moths. It’s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it’s just that he’s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can’t even fly at night or in the rain. “Butterflies are just day-flying moths,” Wahlberg quips. “People think of them as different and special, but they’re not.”\nIn this new era of mass genome sequencing, they’re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera—about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 European Lepidoptera species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg’s reckoning. And they’ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.\nSo the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the micromoths.\nMicromoths have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; the smallest can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as “macromoths”). There are a lot of micromoths—at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.\n  Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThat’s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes. Fortunately, though, it’s a problem for which there is a technological solution: DNA barcoding.\nBesides the DNA in the nuclei of every cell, there exists other genetic material, called mitochondrial DNA, outside of the nucleus. It’s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there’s a mitochondrial gene, called CO1, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. “We have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,” Wahlberg says. “And only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.”\nDNA barcoding was invented in the early 2000s by Paul Hebert and colleagues at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.\n \n  Staﬀ Scientist Silvia Pérez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing. To minimize degradation of the DNA in the samples, they are stored at -80 °C.Luigi Avantaggiato\nGenetic material is isolated from that tissue, and then a CO1 gene is “amplified,” or replicated into many millions of copies, using a standard biotechnical technique called polymerase chain reaction. That material is sequenced using any one of the dozen or more types of sequencing machines available to researchers.\nFor barcoding purposes, typical DNA sequences of the CO1 gene run between 400 and 800 base pairs. But lately researchers have been developing techniques that use shorter or longer barcodes. The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have 100 to 250 base pairs. Conversely, “super-barcodes,” which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species—exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.\nWhy RNA Will Make Annotating Faster\nWhile the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project. Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly, Lycaena helle, a creature that was first studied in 1775. They described their efforts in a paper published by F1000Research.\nThis was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome’s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.\n  Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.Luigi Avantaggiato\nToday, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the thousands of genes within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. “You take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, ‘Ah, look here. There’s a gene that starts here,” says Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG), in Barcelona. “ ‘And this is the structure of the gene.’ And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,” of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.\nGut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or ribonucleic acid. When a gene specifies, or “expresses,” a protein, RNA acts as the “messenger,” carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.\nThe breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article “The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything, in IEEE Spectrum.”] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations—CNAG, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at Pompeu Fabra University, and the University of Barcelona—and from Andorra Research and Innovation, in Sant Julià de Lòria.\nThe genome of the female violet copper butterfly, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also very difficult to predict by computational means. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says Roderic Guigó Serra, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.\n“Long-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,” he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, “we get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,” Serra declares.\n  At the Guigò Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. Luigi Avantaggiato\nHis group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species—including humans. They’re doing this through Gencode, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, “reference” annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it—particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying 18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes. “These genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,” says Serra.\nResearchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world’s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe’s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.\nIt’s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. “My loathings are simple,” he wrote in 1973. “Stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music. My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing and butterfly hunting.”",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM.

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic.

      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "title": "Volcanologists Turn to a High-Tech Suitcase to Study Eruptions",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/volcano-monitoring-stromboli-skate",
      "description": "When hundreds of volcanologists gathered in Geneva last July for the world’s largest volcanology conference, Italy’s Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) drew particular attention. INGV was presenting results from five years of very close range observations of Stromboli, one of the Mediterranean’s most monitored volcanoes. Its frequent small eruptions make it both a natural laboratory for vulcanologists and a constant safety concern for the island’s roughly 500 residents and thousands of tourists.\nThe last three years of close observations were made possible by a portable observatory called the Setup for the Kinematic Acquisition of Explosive Eruptions, or SKATE. The suitcase-sized system is packed with tech that captures eruptions at hundreds of frames per second, synchronously recording their roar and their heat.\nFilming and analyzing an explosive eruption up close for hours, while capturing data about its heat, sound, and motion, has historically been tricky and dangerous. But that’s the data scientists need to understand how eruptions work and evolve over time. SKATE makes that process both safer and simpler by autonomously recording synchronized streams of observatory data and minimizing the time researchers need to spend on a volcano’s slopes.\n“Explosive eruptions are extremely fast processes with particles the size of a truck or a grain of dust that can travel from a few meters per second to supersonic speeds,” says Jacopo Taddeucci, a senior researcher at INGV. “You need cameras shooting hundreds of frames per second and instruments that can see, hear, and feel the eruption at once to understand cause and effect.”\nAside from Stromboli, SKATE has been tested on the nearby Mount Etna, as well as on Guatemala’s Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live near active volcanoes, many of which are without any monitoring system. INGV is now planning deployments on other volcanoes, including Mount Yasur in Vanuatu, known as the “Lighthouse of the Pacific” for its near continuous eruptions featuring rhythmic bursts of incandescent lava and gas.\nSKATE’s Innovative Volcanology Technology\nSKATE was assembled by Technology Equipment Engineering Solutions (TEES), an Italian manufacturer of custom scientific instruments and Dewesoft, a Slovenian company specializing in high-speed data acquisition and measurement systems. The two companies followed INGV’s specifications to pack an entire observatory into a rigid polypropylene shell on a €50,000 (about US $58,000) budget.\nSKATE is the streamlined successor to an earlier INGV prototype known as FAMoUS (Fast Multiparametric Setup), which first proved the value of combining high-speed, thermal, and acoustic sensors. But it also came with serious drawbacks: It was heavy and bulky, took a long time to install on site, and required manual triggering, which forced researchers to spend hours in hazardous zones to capture only a handful of sequences.\n  SKATE is more portable and easier to deploy than its predecessor, a system called FAMoUS.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nInside SKATE, a waterproof PC coordinates a thermal camera recording at 32 frames per second, and a high-speed camera that records bursts of footage when it detects sudden temperature spikes. Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE’s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.\n“The real challenge wasn’t plugging in cameras and sensors,” says Alessia Longo, an engineer at Dewesoft. “It was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.”\nThat data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on solar panels and replaceable batteries.\n“The creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,” says Piergiorgio Scarlato, INGV’s research director.\nModular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring\nPlaced between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli’s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. \nThe design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify sulfur dioxide emissions. It’s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano’s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.\n“Depth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,” says Scarlato “By understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.”\nOn Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs—chunks of lava flung out during an eruption—and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.\nSKATE’s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis\nSKATE isn’t a 24/7 alarm. It’s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater—such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments—to make better sense of their signals.\n  A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nData from SKATE is helping scientists test hypotheses about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can’t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.\nSKATE’s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent research campaign on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli’s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.\nDespite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. “Working in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,” says Scarlato. “The difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.”",

      "title": "Novel Geothermal System to Come Online in Germany",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/advanced-geothermal-germany",
      "description": "This article was originally published by Canary Media.\nEavor, an advanced-geothermal startup, says it has significantly reduced drilling times and improved technologies at its nearly online project in Germany—milestones that should help it drive down the costs of harnessing clean energy from the ground.\nIn late October, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel “closed-loop” geothermal systems in hotter and deeper locations than conventional projects can access.\n“Much like wind and solar have come down the cost curve, much like unconventional shale [oil and gas] have come down the cost curve, we now have a technical proof-point that we’ve done that in Europe,” Jeanine Vany, a cofounder and executive vice president of corporate affairs at Eavor, said from the Geothermal Rising conference in Reno, Nevada.\nEavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms—including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy—are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.\nThe industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.\nEavor’s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany \nEavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund. For its first “loop,” the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly 2.8 miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells—like tines of a fork—that each stretch 1.8 miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.\nOperations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March 2026. All told, the system will supply 8.2 megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and 64 MW of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. \nIn its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 100 days to complete—a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $100,000 a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by 50 percent.\nFor example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.\nOn top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35 percent, Vany said.\nThe Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches—like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada—are also scaling up.\nChallenges in Geothermal Drilling\nEnhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater—though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.\nBut the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.\n“While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,” Tester said. “You can get energy out of the ground; it’s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?”\nVany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the “levelized cost of heat” in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $50 and $100 per megawatt-hour thermal in the region’s volatile energy market, she said.\n“After we’ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,” Vany added. “And that’s the purpose of the Geretsried project.”",
