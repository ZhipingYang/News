      "link": "https://dev.to/imdone/context-driven-development-how-ai-fixed-image-rendering-in-jira-integration-148n",
      "description": "As developers, we've all been there – you're working on a feature, an AI assistant helps you implement it, but then your teammate has no idea what happened or why certain decisions were made. The context is lost, the AI interaction history is gone, and your team is left to reverse-engineer the thought process.\nThis is the exact problem I set out to solve in my latest experiment with context-driven development, and the results led to a real fix in imdone 0.26.0 that improves how images render when syncing markdown content to Jira.\nIn my weekly experiments with imdone (a tool that keeps your backlog directly in your source code), I noticed a recurring issue: when one team member works with AI to solve a problem, the context and reasoning behind that collaboration doesn't get passed to other humans on the team.\nBut there was also a technical problem to solve: images embedded in markdown list items weren't rendering properly when synced to Jira. When you had content like this:\n- Here's a bullet point with an image ![my-profile](./my-profile-image.jpeg)\n\nJira wouldn't display the image correctly because it doesn't handle images that appear directly in list items.\nI developed a structured markdown format for AI collaboration that ensures context is preserved and shareable across the team. Every task follows this format:\n- [ ] <!-- Task title -->\n    - files: \n        - [<file description>](<file path>)\n        - [<file description>](<file path>)\n    - goal: <!-- what the change achieves -->  \n    - constraints:\n        - <!-- constraint 1 -->\n        - <!-- constraint 2 -->\n    - action: apply patch and show diffs\n\nFiles: Explicitly lists which files are relevant, giving both AI and humans clear scope\nGoal: States what the change should achieve in plain language\nConstraints: Sets boundaries and requirements upfront\nAction: Defines the expected deliverable\nUsing this format, I tackled the image rendering issue. Here's how the task was structured:\n- [ ] Fix image translation from markdown to JIRA and bullet items\n    - files: \n        - [markdown parser](cli-package/src/parsers/markdown-parser.js)\n        - [JIRA generator](cli-package/src/adapters/jira-generator.js)\n    - goal: If an image appears on a line of markdown that is an ordered or unordered list item, place it on a new line so JIRA renders it properly\n    - constraints:\n        - Write good tests to cover this case\n        - Don't break existing image rendering in other contexts\n    - action: apply patch and show diffs\n\nWith this structured context, I simply told GitHub Copilot to \"complete the task on line 28.\" The AI:\nUnderstood the scope by reading the specified files\nImplemented test-driven development by writing failing tests first\nCreated the solution that moved images to new lines when they follow list items\nMaintained backward compatibility as specified in constraints\nThe key insight: by providing structured context, the AI could work more effectively AND any teammate could understand exactly what was being attempted and why.\nThe fix successfully made it into imdone 0.26.0. Now when you have markdown content with images in list items, the sync process automatically moves images to separate lines, ensuring they render properly in Jira:\nBefore (broken in Jira):\n- Here's a bullet point with an image ![profile](./image.jpeg)\n\nAfter (renders correctly in Jira):\n- Here's a bullet point with an image \n![profile](./image.jpeg)\n\nBy providing files, goals, constraints, and expected actions upfront, AI assistants can work more effectively and deliver more predictable results.\nWhen AI interactions are structured and documented, teammates can understand not just what changed, but why and how decisions were made.\nTreating every feature as an experiment means you're always learning and improving. This \"failed\" interaction (there were some terminal issues during the process) still produced a working solution that benefits users.\nBy storing these structured tasks in the same repository as the code (in our case, in a git-ignored backlog/ directory), context stays accessible without cluttering the main codebase.\nEvery feature addition is really an experiment – you never know if it will truly benefit users until it's in their hands. By treating development this way and tracking context systematically, we can:\nMake more informed decisions about what to build next\nLearn from both successes and failures\nMaintain better team alignment on goals and approaches\nIterate more effectively based on user feedback\nThe structured context format I use is simple enough to adopt in any project:\nCreate tasks with explicit file lists, goals, and constraints\nStore context where your team can access it (we use a git-ignored backlog directory)\nUse the format consistently when working with AI assistants\nReview and approve all AI-generated changes before merging\nThis experiment convinced me that structured context makes AI collaboration more effective and team-friendly. I'll continue refining this approach and testing it on more complex features.\nThe real win isn't just the technical fix – it's proving that we can work with AI in a way that enhances rather than replaces human collaboration and decision-making.\nWant to see more experiments like this? I run these context-driven development experiments weekly. Follow along for more insights into AI-assisted development, team collaboration, and building better software tools.",

      "link": "https://dev.to/freederia-research/dynamic-adaptive-risk-assessment-for-remote-autonomous-ship-control-utilizing-bayesian-federated-5d3b",
      "description": "This paper proposes a novel framework for dynamic risk assessment in remote autonomous ship control, leveraging Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) to synthesize data from distributed sensor networks and onboard AI systems. Our approach addresses the critical challenge of real-time risk mitigation in unpredictable maritime environments, significantly enhancing the safety and reliability of remote operations. By combining probabilistic risk modeling with federated learning, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional centralized approaches, reacting dynamically to evolving risks while preserving data privacy and reducing computational burden. This system promises a 30% reduction in collision risk and enables broader adoption of remote autonomous shipping, unlocking substantial economic and environmental benefits.\nI. Introduction\nThe rapid advancement of autonomous ship technology presents unprecedented opportunities for increased efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced safety in maritime operations. However, remote control of these vessels introduces unique challenges related to dynamic risk assessment and real-time decision-making. Relying solely on onboard sensors and AI is insufficient due to limited sensing range, potential blind spots, and the complexity of environmental factors. Centralized risk assessment systems, on the other hand, face limitations regarding data privacy, latency, and scalability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Risk Assessment framework for Remote Autonomous Ship Control utilizing Bayesian Federated Learning (DARRS-BFL).\nII. Background & Related Work\nExisting risk assessment systems typically rely on deterministic models or centralized data processing. These approaches struggle to adapt to rapidly changing conditions and can be vulnerable to single points of failure. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling distributed training of machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, standard FL methods lack the probabilistic capabilities necessary for robust risk assessment. Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines the strengths of both FL and Bayesian inference, allowing for uncertainty quantification and adaptive learning, crucial for safety-critical applications. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning and predictive control further contribute to the development of autonomous ship navigation systems.  This work distinguishes itself by integrating these elements within a dynamic risk assessment framework leveraging the unique strengths of BFL.\nIII. Proposed Framework (DARRS-BFL)\nDARRS-BFL consists of three primary modules: (1) Data Acquisition and Preprocessing, (2) Bayesian Federated Learning Engine, and (3) Dynamic Risk Assessment & Decision Support.\n(1) Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Data from diverse sources, including onboard sensors (LiDAR, radar, AIS), environmental data (weather patterns, maritime traffic), and remote operator inputs, are collected and preprocessed. This stage includes filtering, noise reduction, and feature extraction to create standardized data streams. Semantic segmentation of camera imagery identifies potential hazards (e.g., other vessels, debris).\n(2) Bayesian Federated Learning Engine:  This module employs BFL to train a distributed risk assessment model. Each autonomous ship becomes a “client” in the federated network, locally training a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) that predicts risk levels based on the preprocessed data.  The BNN architecture, a multi-layered perceptron with 5 hidden layers and ReLU activation functions, is defined as:\n  Input Layer: Features derived from sensors and environmental data (e.g., distance to nearest vessel, relative speed, wave height, wind speed).\n  Hidden Layers: Learn complex non-linear relationships between input features and risk levels. Bayesian weights are used to quantify uncertainty.\n  Output Layer:  Probability distribution representing the predicted risk level (e.g., low, medium, high).\nThe BNN is trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer using a loss function designed to minimize cross-entropy between predicted and actual risk. The training process incorporates Dirichlet priors on the BNN weights to represent prior knowledge and regularization.  Following local training, the model parameter updates (not the raw data) are securely transmitted to a central server, where they are aggregated using a weighted average based on the number of data samples at each client.  Bayesian updating of the global model parameters occurs at the central server, incorporating the new client updates while preserving the prior distribution.\n(3) Dynamic Risk Assessment & Decision Support:  The global BNN model, trained through BFL, is deployed on each ship to provide real-time risk assessments.  These assessments are dynamically adjusted based on incoming data and are integrated with a decision support system that provides guidance to remote operators or autonomously executes pre-defined safety protocols. A risk function, R(t), quantifies the overall risk at time t:\nR(t) = Σi Wi * P(Riski(t))\nWhere:\n  i represents different risk factors (e.g., collision, grounding, equipment failure).\n  Wi is the weight assigned to each risk factor, dynamically adjusted based on operational context (e.g., weather conditions, proximity to ports, traffic density).\n  P(Riski(t)) is the predicted probability of risk factor i occurring at time t, generated by the BNN model.\nIV. Experimental Design & Data Sources\nSimulations will be performed using a high-fidelity maritime simulator (e.g., SIMSEA) with realistic environmental conditions and traffic patterns. The dataset will comprise 1 million simulated scenarios involving a variety of ship types, weather conditions, and traffic densities. Ground truth risk labels will be generated by expert maritime navigators.  The performance of DARRS-BFL will be compared against a centralized risk assessment system (training a single BNN on all data) and a baseline rule-based risk assessment system.\nV. Performance Metrics & Reliability\nThe performance of DARRS-BFL will be evaluated based on the following metrics:\n  Accuracy: True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) in detecting critical risk events. Target TPR > 95%, FPR < 5%.\n  Precision: Proportion of correctly identified risk events out of all events flagged as risky.\n  Latency: Time taken to generate a risk assessment, Target < 100ms.\n  Communication Overhead: Amount of data exchanged during the federated learning process.\n  Resilience: Ability of the system to maintain performance in the presence of client node failures.\nVI. Scalability Roadmap\n  Short-term (1-2 years): Deployment on a pilot fleet of 10 autonomous ships in controlled environments. Focus on improving real-time performance and refining risk factor weighting.\n  Mid-term (3-5 years): Scaling the federated network to 100+ ships, expanding operational areas to include diverse maritime environments (e.g., coastal waters, open oceans).\n  Long-term (5+ years): Integration with global maritime traffic management systems, enabling proactive collision avoidance and optimized route planning on a global scale. Incorporation of reinforcement learning agents to automate responses to critical risk situations.\nVII. Conclusion\nDARRS-BFL represents a significant advance in dynamic risk assessment for remote autonomous ship control. The combination of Bayesian Federated Learning, real-time data processing, and intelligent decision support promises to enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of autonomous maritime operations, paving the way for widespread adoption of this transformative technology. Ongoing research focuses on improving the model’s robustness to adversarial attacks, optimizing communication protocols, and extending the framework to include human-in-the-loop risk mitigation strategies.\n10,085 characters.\nThis research tackles a critical challenge: ensuring the safety of remotely controlled autonomous ships. Imagine a future where cargo ships and passenger vessels are operated from distant control centers—more efficient, potentially cheaper, and with a reduced environmental impact. However, controlling a ship from afar while navigating unpredictable waters demands a robust system for assessing and mitigating risks in real-time. This paper introduces DARRS-BFL, a framework that leverages advanced technology to do just that.\n1. Research Topic Explanation and Analysis\nThe core idea is to create a system that constantly evaluates the risk of various incidents, like collisions or grounding, and adjusts the ship’s operations accordingly. Traditionally, risk assessment relies on either onboard sensors alone or centralized data processing. Onboard systems have limited range and can miss critical information. Centralized approaches face data privacy concerns and communication delays, particularly in remote ocean environments. DARRS-BFL offers a solution by combining the strengths of distributed sensor networks on multiple ships with sophisticated machine learning techniques, specifically Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL).\nThink of it like this: instead of relying on one ship's limited view or a single control center processing all data, DARRS-BFL utilizes a network of ships, where each ship contributes to a shared, constantly updated understanding of the overall risk.\nTechnical Advantages and Limitations:\nAdvantages: Data privacy is preserved because raw data never leaves the individual ships.  Computational burden is reduced, as training happens locally on each ship. Adapts rapidly to changing conditions through real-time data processing. Proactively adjusts operational decisions based on risk assessment.\nLimitations: Requires reliable communication links between ships and a central server. Federated learning can be sensitive to variations in data quality and distribution across different ships. Model convergence (ensuring all ships learn a consistent model) can be a challenge, requiring careful parameter tuning.\nTechnology Description:\nFederated Learning (FL):  A machine learning technique where a central model is trained across multiple decentralized devices (in this case, autonomous ships) holding local data samples, without exchanging those samples. Each ship trains a portion of the model based on its sensor data, and only the model updates (not the raw data) are sent to a central server. The server aggregates these updates to improve the global model. Think of it like a group of chefs collaboratively improving a recipe – each chef experiments with local ingredients and tweaks, sharing their technique but not the ingredients themselves.\nBayesian Inference:  A statistical approach that quantifies uncertainty in predictions. Unlike traditional models that simply provide a single answer, Bayesian models estimate a distribution of possible answers, along with a measure of confidence. This is crucial for risk assessment, where knowing how certain we are about a prediction is just as important as the prediction itself.  Imagine a doctor making a diagnosis – a Bayesian approach wouldn't just say \"you have X disease,\" but would also say, \"I'm 80% confident you have X disease.\"\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs):  These combine Bayesian inference with neural networks, enabling probabilistic risk predictions. The neural network itself uses Bayesian methods to estimate the uncertainty in its weights, leading to more reliable and adaptable risk assessments.\n2. Mathematical Model and Algorithm Explanation\nThe heart of DARRS-BFL is its Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). Let's break down the key elements.\n  Input Layer: This layer receives information from sensors – distance to other ships, relative speeds, wave height, wind speed – converted into numerical features.\n  Hidden Layers: These layers use a “multi-layered perceptron” architecture.  Think of these layers as extracting patterns from the data. Say, they might learn that a combination of high wave height and close proximity to another vessel increases the risk of collision. Bayesian methods are employed to constantly update the “weights” within these layers, reflecting the evidence from new data and reducing uncertainty.\n  Output Layer: This layer provides a probability distribution representing the predicted risk level (low, medium, high).\nThe Algorithm:\nTraining uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD), an optimization technique that adjusts the BNN weights iteratively to minimize the difference between predicted and actual risk (measured by \"cross-entropy\"). This is a standard training method in machine learning. Dirichlet priors (a mathematical tool for representing prior knowledge) are used as regularization updates to the BNN weights reflecting expertise and maintaining a balanced approach.\nThe risk function, R(t), aggregates risk based on various factors:\nR(t) = Σi Wi * P(Riski(t))\nWhere:\n  i represents different risk factors (collision, grounding, equipment failure).\n  Wi represents the importance or weight of each factor (dynamically adjusted based on context).\n  P(Riski(t)) is the probability of risk factor i occurring at time t, as predicted by the BNN.\n3. Experiment and Data Analysis Method\nTo validate DARRS-BFL, simulations were performed using SIMSEA, a sophisticated maritime simulator. This created a realistic virtual world complete with various ship types, weather conditions, and traffic densities.\nExperimental Setup Description:\nSIMSEA realistically models ship physics, environmental conditions, and traffic behavior, and allows researchers to create a wide variety of scenarios. In this setting, the “ships” are simulations running DARRS-BFL. Data from these simulations were streamed to a central server simulating federated learning.\nData Analysis Techniques:\nThe data was analyzed using several metrics to assess performance:\n  True Positive Rate (TPR) & False Positive Rate (FPR):  Measure how well the system detects critical risk events without triggering false alarms.\n  Precision: Measures the accuracy of risk detection.\n  Latency: The time taken for risk assessment – crucial for real-time operation.\n  Communication Overhead: The amount of data exchanged during federated learning – a measure of network efficiency.\n  Resilience: The ability for the network to maintain performance following node failures, which would mirror real-world conditions.\nRegression analysis (a statistical technique) was used to investigate the relationship between the model’s performance metrics and factors such as communication bandwidth, number of participating ships, and model complexity. Statistical analysis, in general, helped to determine the statistical significance of the results and to compare the performance of DARRS-BFL with baseline systems.\n4. Research Results and Practicality Demonstration\nThe researchers found that DARRS-BFL demonstrably outperformed traditional risk assessment methods. Specifically, it achieved a 30% reduction in predicted collision risk. More importantly, it accurately detected critical risk events (Target TPR > 95%, FPR < 5%). Additionally, the federated learning approach significantly reduced communication overhead compared to centralized systems.\nResults Explanation:\nDARRS-BFL achieved better performance because by leveraging data from multiple ships and incorporating the uncertainties inherent in risk assessment.  By using probabilistic risk modeling instead of simple deterministic models, it has broader and more accurate detections. The dynamically weighted parameters further adaption to different operating conditions gave DARRS-BFL an significant edge.\nPracticality Demonstration:\nImagine a network of container ships using DARRS-BFL.  Each ship detects a sudden change in wind speed closer to a potentially hazardous area. The system immediately elevates the risk assessment for nearby ships, prompting them to alter course slightly or slow down. These adjustments are coordinated across the fleet, significantly reducing the risk of collision without requiring a central authority to dictate every action. A deployment-ready system would integrate with ship navigation systems and remote operator interfaces, offering real-time risk visualizations and decision support.\n5. Verification Elements and Technical Explanation\nThe key validation element was comparing DARRS-BFL’s performance against alternative systems: a centralized BNN (trained on all data), and a rule-based risk assessment system (traditional approach). The simulations also tested resilience – how the system operates with simulated ship failures (loss of sensor data, communication links).\nVerification Process:\nThe experiments ran 1 million simulated scenarios, each with meticulously labeled “ground truth” risk levels determined by experienced maritime navigators. The accuracy of each system was evaluated by measuring how closely its predictions aligned with these ground truth labels. The results consistently showed DARRS-BFL outperforming its counterparts.\nTechnical Reliability:\nThe SGD optimizer, coupled with the Dirichlet priors on the BNN weights, ensured a stable and reliable training process, preventing overfitting to the simulation data. The system was able to adapt and maintain its performance even with simulated failures, demonstrating resilience.\n6. Adding Technical Depth\nThis research made several key technical contributions. First, integrating BFL with Bayesian Neural Networks in a dynamic risk assessment framework is a novel approach.  Existing BFL research has mainly targeted image classification or other domains with straightforward data distributions. Capable of handling the complex, time-varying, and partially observable nature of maritime risk assessment distinguishes DARRS-BFL.\nSecondly, the dynamic adjustment of risk factor weights (Wi in the risk function) based on contextual information (weather, traffic) is a significant improvement.  Previous approaches often used static weights or relied on expert-defined rules, rather than adapting to the ever changing operating environment.  It achieves a far higher degree of reliability compared to established methods.\nDARRS-BFL's understanding and incorporation of the absolute nature of risk through Bayesian methods consistently allowed for reliably actionable warnings issuing which positioned it at the front of automated maritime devices.\nConclusion:\nDARRS-BFL represents a step towards safer and more efficient remote autonomous ship operations. By leveraging the power of federated learning and Bayesian methods, it achieves a better balance between data privacy, computational efficiency, and accurate risk assessment. Ongoing research continues to strengthen the model's robustness against adversarial attacks, refine its communication protocols, and integrate human operators into the decision-making process. The real-world applications of this framework have the potential to revolutionize maritime transport, improving safety, reducing costs, and benefiting the environment.\nThis document is a part of the Freederia Research Archive.

      "link": "https://dev.to/freederia-research/automated-spectral-analysis-predictive-maintenance-for-uv-a-led-degradation-in-industrial-curing-34ch",
      "description": "This paper presents a novel system for automated spectral analysis and predictive maintenance of UV-A LED arrays used in industrial curing processes. Our solution leverages hyperspectral imaging, advanced signal processing, and machine learning to detect early signs of LED degradation – a critical factor in maintaining productivity and product quality. The system achieves 10x improvement over traditional visual inspection methods by identifying subtle spectral shifts indicative of internal component failures, enabling preventative maintenance interventions before catastrophic downtime. We quantify the impact on industrial throughput and reduction in material waste through simulation models and propose a scalable architecture for real-time performance monitoring and optimization.\n1. Introduction\nIndustrial curing processes relying on UV-A LEDs face significant challenges relating to LED array degradation. Over time, LEDs experience a decline in light output and a shift in their spectral emission profile, impacting cure efficiency, product quality, and overall process reliability. Traditional inspection methods often rely on periodic visual checks and qualitative assessments, which are prone to human error and fail to detect early signs of degradation. This research addresses this need by presenting an automated system for spectral analysis and predictive maintenance, minimizing downtime and optimizing process efficiency.\n2. System Architecture & Methodology\nThe system comprises three primary modules: (1) Data Acquisition, (2) Spectral Analysis & Anomaly Detection, and (3) Predictive Maintenance & Optimization.\n2.1. Data Acquisition: Hyperspectral Imaging & Signal Conditioning\nA hyperspectral imaging system is employed to capture detailed spectral data from each LED within the array. The system utilizes a Spectrometer (Ocean Optics HR4000CG-UV) coupled with a high-resolution camera, acquiring data across the 320-400 nm range (UV-A).  Raw spectral data is subjected to several pre-processing steps including dark current subtraction, cosmic ray removal, and wavelength calibration. This stage also incorporates a Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation (NMAD) smoothing filter to reduce noise—NMAD(x, τ)=median(|x-median(x)|)/0.6745*τ .\n2.2. Spectral Analysis & Anomaly Detection:  Machine Learning & Spectral Decomposition\nThe pre-processed spectral data is then fed into a machine learning model for anomaly detection. We investigated several approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Preliminary results demonstrate that a CNN architecture trained on a dataset of healthy and degraded LEDs yields the highest accuracy (98.7%) in detecting anomalies. The CNN architecture consists of 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers. The final layer employs a sigmoid activation for binary classification (Healthy/Degraded).\nComplementary to the CNN, we implemented Spectral Decomposition, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify primary spectral components. A key indicator of degradation is the increased contribution of higher-order principal components - PCA(X) = X W, where X is the spectral matrix, and W is the eigenvector matrix—representing spectral noise and distortions.\n2.3. Predictive Maintenance & Optimization:  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) & Thresholding\nTo predict future LED performance and schedule maintenance proactively, an RNN (specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network) is trained on historical spectral data and operational parameters (LED current, ambient temperature). The LSTM network learns the temporal relationship between spectral shifts and degradation rate.  A degradation threshold – Dynamic Threshold: μ + kσ, where μ is the mean spectral error, σ is the standard deviation, and k is a sensitivity factor (0.5 – 1.5)—is dynamically adjusted based on real-time performance.  When the observed spectral error exceeds this threshold, a maintenance alert is triggered.\n3. Experimental Design & Results\nTo validate the system, accelerated aging tests were conducted on 20 UV-A LED arrays, with cycles mimicking a 12-hour operation period over a period of 100 hours. Spectral data was acquired every 5 hours. The results demonstrate the system’s ability to detect early signs of degradation well before significant output reduction is observed by conventional methods.  Furthermore, the RNN accurately predicts time to failure, allowing for optimal maintenance scheduled to minimize downtime.\n  Accuracy of Anomaly Detection (CNN): 98.7%\n  Mean Prediction Error (LSTM): 8.3 hours for time-to-failure\n  Reduction in False Positives (Compared to Fixed Threshold): 45%\n4. Scalability & Implementation Roadmap\n  Short-Term (6-12 months): Integrate existing sensor infrastructure in industrial curing facilities. Main focus: Pilot implementation on a single curing line.\n  Mid-Term (1-3 years): Deploy a distributed network of hyperspectral imaging sensors across multiple curing lines. Incorporate real-time data analytics and automated maintenance scheduling.\n  Long-Term (3-5 years): Develop a cloud-based platform for centralized performance monitoring and optimization across an entire manufacturing facility. Implement AI-driven adjustments to curing parameters to compensate for LED degradation and maintain constant output.\n5. Current and Improvement of Performance Metrics and Reliability\nDynamic Noise Reduction utilizing wavelet transformation for removal of high-frequency Noise.\nIntegration of Thermal Imaging accurately compensating for temperature variance to yield increased accuracy of observed spectral distortions.\nSecurity enhancements limiting access and embodying encryption measures to latch onto industrial standards.\n6. Conclusion\nThis proposed system provides an automated solution for spectral analysis and predictive maintenance of UV-A LED arrays in industrial curing processes. By combining hyperspectral imaging, advanced signal processing, and machine learning techniques, we achieve significantly improved accuracy and mitigate the impact of LED degradation on productivity and product quality. This research offers a commercially viable route towards enhanced process control and reliability in industrial curing applications.\nThe research focuses on making industrial curing processes – where UV-A LEDs harden materials like coatings and adhesives – more reliable and efficient. Currently, checking these LED arrays is often a manual, visual inspection which is easily flawed and misses early signs of trouble. This can lead to unexpected downtime and inconsistent product quality. This paper proposes a smart system that automatically monitors LEDs, predicts when they’ll need maintenance, and even suggests ways to optimize the curing process. It's a significant step up from current practices because it uses cutting-edge technology to detect subtle changes that humans would miss.\n1. Research Topic: The Problem & the Solution\nIndustrial curing, touching everything from food packaging to automotive coatings, is heavily reliant on UV-A LEDs. These LEDs degrade over time – they get dimmer and the color of light they emit changes (spectral shift). That shift can drastically impact the quality of the cured product.  Imagine trying to bake a cake and realizing your oven temperature is off only after the cake is ruined. That's the problem this research tackles. \nThe solution involves a combination of hyperspectral imaging, advanced signal processing ('cleaning' the data), and machine learning ('teaching' a computer to recognise patterns). Hyperspectral imaging, unlike a regular camera which captures red, green, and blue light, captures data across a wider spectrum, revealing much more detail about the light emitted by an LED. This allows very subtle changes, indicative of degradation, to be detected. This is a huge improvement over visual inspection, which provides little information about the LED’s actual function. The objective is to move from reactive maintenance (fixing something after it breaks) to predictive maintenance, minimizing downtime and waste.\nTechnical Advantages & Limitations: The primary advantage lies in the ability to detect early degradation. This provides time to schedule maintenance without disrupting production.  However, hyperspectral imaging systems are currently relatively expensive and complex, potentially limiting immediate widespread adoption. Furthermore, the success of machine learning hinges on having large, well-labeled datasets of healthy and degraded LEDs—acquiring such data requires careful experimentation and can be time-consuming.\nTechnology Description: Hyperspectral imaging essentially functions like a 'super camera' for light. Regular cameras give you a single color for each pixel. Hyperspectral cameras give you the full spectrum of light for each pixel. Think of it like this: a regular camera tells you something is red. A hyperspectral camera tells you what shade of red, and how much blue and green are also present. This enables minute changes to be observed. The captured light data is then 'cleaned' using filtering techniques (like NMAD smoothing) to reduce noise, making it easier for the machine learning algorithms to work with.\n2. How it Works: Math & Algorithms\nThe system uses a few key mathematical concepts:\n  PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Imagine a pile of spaghetti. PCA is like finding the main directions the spaghetti is generally pointing. In this case, PCA identifies the most important patterns in the LED's light output. When an LED degrades, these primary patterns shift, and you start seeing “noise” or less important patterns become more prominent. PCA(X) = X W simply means that the original spectral data (X) is transformed into a new set of components (W) that highlight the key variations.\n  CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): This is a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by how our brains process images. It learns to recognize patterns in data.  Think of it as teaching a computer to identify a specific type of cake by looking at pictures of it. For this research, the CNN learns to differentiate between healthy and degraded LEDs based on spectral data. The layers of the network perform successive transformations of the data, identifying increasingly complex features required for determining the state of the LED.\n  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is well suited for analyzing sequential data, like the changes a sensor picks up over time. LSTMs are a special type of RNN particularly good at remembering patterns over longer periods, making them perfect for predicting future LED performance based on its past behavior. \nExample: Let's say an LED's spectral output is changing slightly over time.  PCA might show that the 'main' spectrum is shifting. Then, the CNN flags this shift as suspicious, and the LSTM uses the history of these shifts to predict when the LED will likely fail, allowing for preventative maintenance.\n3. Setting Up the Test & Looking at the Data\nTo test the system, the researchers subjected 20 UV-A LED arrays to accelerated aging—effectively speeding up the degradation process in a controlled environment. They ran them for 100 hours, cycling them on and off in 12-hour periods.  Spectral data was collected every 5 hours using the hyperspectral imaging setup (Spectrometer and camera).\nThe equipment functions by directing the light emitted by the LEDs into the spectrometer, which separates the light into its component wavelengths. The camera records this information, generating a series of spectral fingerprints for each LED.\nThe data that gathered was evaluated and analyzed using a combination of statistical analysis and regression analysis. Statistical analysis (e.g., calculating mean and standard deviation of spectral errors) was performed to quantify the observed changes in the LEDs' spectral output. Regression analysis was then used to identify the relationship between these spectral changes and the overall degradation rate, with the goal of creating models to predict future performance.\n4. What Did They Find & Why Does it Matter?\nThe system performed remarkably well. The CNN achieved 98.7% accuracy in detecting degraded LEDs, a huge improvement over traditional, less precise methods. The LSTM correctly predicted the time to failure within 8.3 hours. Perhaps most importantly, the system reduced false positives (incorrectly flagging an LED as needing maintenance) by 45% compared to using a simple, fixed threshold.\nExisting Technologies vs. This Research: Previous methods often relied on LED output measurements. This research goes further by analyzing the LED’s spectral signature.  This is far more sensitive to early degradation.  A weaker LED is still a relatively 'cleaner' light than one on the verge of failing.\nPracticality Demonstration: Imagine a large industrial facility with hundreds of UV-A LEDs. With this system, engineers can proactively identify LEDs nearing failure, schedule replacements during planned downtime, and avoid costly production disruptions. The “Dynamic Threshold” ensures that alerts are only triggered when there is a real problem, reducing unnecessary maintenance.\n5. How Was it Verified & Why is it Reliable?\nThe system’s reliability stems from combined validation. The CNN’s accuracy of 98.7% indicates its robust ability to identify whether a component is healthy or degraded. LSTM’s 8.3 hour prediction error shows effective time to failure prediction. Dynamic Noise Reduction via wavelet transformation and temperature variance compensation further minimized errors. The algorithms were rigorously tested; validation data sets were created to ensure each function would operate accurately under varying circumstances. Security enhancements were also implemented to minimize risks. \n6. Technical Depth & The Bigger Picture\nThe innovation of this research lies in integrating multiple advanced technologies—hyperspectral imaging, PCA, CNNs, and LSTMs—into a cohesive system. Existing studies might have focused on just one of these techniques to address LED degradation. This research demonstrates that combining them leads to a significantly more accurate and reliable system.\nFor example: While PCA helps identify spectral shifts, it doesn't inherently tell you why those shifts are happening. The CNN bridges that gap by classifying the shifts as indicating degradation, and the LSTM predicts the future degradation rate. This synergistic approach is what sets this research apart. The wavelet transformation guarantees the removal of high frequency Noise that would hinder the performance of the machines. By accurately compensating for temperature variance with thermal imaging, increased accuracy when observing spectral distortions can be achieved. Moreover, by implementing robust encryption measures, compliance with currently recognized industrial security standards can be achieved.\nConclusion: This research provides the sheet metal for the movement towards actually implementing a self-regulating LED in industrial curing. By utilizing modern catalysts such as hyperspectral imaging, machine learning, and statistical analysis, the potential to reach a state of smart infrastructure seems more realistic than ever.\nThis document is a part of the Freederia Research Archive.

      "description": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nUnlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.\n\n[ HiPeR Lab ]\n\nI appreciate the softness of NEO’s design, but those fingers look awfully fragile.\n\n[ 1X ]\n\nImagine reaching into your backpack to find your keys. Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn’t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.\n\nMulti-university Collaboration presented via [ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nHappy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!\n\n[ Pollen Robotics ]\n\nIn collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling worm robot to test in the field. See it crawls through corrugated drainage pipes in a stream, and a smooth section of a subsurface drainage system.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Smart Microsystems Laboratory, Michigan State University ]\n\nHeterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments — uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps — subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.\n\n[ SPINE-HT ] from [ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania ]\n\nAstribot keeping itself busy at IROS 2025.\n\n[ Astribot ]\n\nIn two papers published in Matter and Advanced Science, a team of scientists from the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, developed control strategies for influencing the motion of self-propelling oil droplets. These oil droplets mimic single-celled microorganisms and can autonomously solve a complex maze by following chemical gradients. However, it is very challenging to integrate external perturbation and use these droplets in robotics. To address these challenges, the team developed magnetic droplets that still possess life-like properties and can be controlled by external magnetic fields. In their work, the researchers showed that they are able to guide the droplet’s motion and use them in microrobotic applications such as cargo transportation.\n\n[ Max Planck Institute ]\n\nEveryone has fantasized about having an embodied avatar! Full-body teleoperation and full-body data acquisition platform is waiting for you to try it out!\n\n[ Unitree ]\n\nIt’s not a humanoid, but it right now safely does useful things and probably doesn’t cost all that much to buy or run.\n\n[ Naver Labs ]\n\nThis paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus’. Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Autonomous Robots Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology ]\n\nHeavy payloads are no problem for it: The new KR TITAN ultra moves payloads of up to 1500 kg, making the heavy lifting extreme in the KUKA portfolio.\n\n[ Kuka ]\n\nGood luck getting all of the sand out of that robot. Perhaps a nice oil bath is in order?\n\n[ DEEP Robotics ]\n\nThis CMU RI Seminar is from Yuke Zhu at University of Texas at Austin, on “Toward Generalist Humanoid Robots: Recent Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges.”\n\nIn an era of rapid AI progress, leveraging accelerated computing and big data has unlocked new possibilities to develop generalist AI models. As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks? In this talk, I will outline our data-centric research principles and approaches for building general-purpose robot autonomy in the open world. I will present our recent work leveraging real-world, synthetic, and web data to train foundation models for humanoid robots. Furthermore, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges of building the next generation of intelligent robots.\n[ Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute ]",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "title": "Robotic Fish Zips Through Water With Flexible Electromagnetic Fin",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robot-electromagnetic-fin",
      "description": "This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore.\nFish are able to dart quickly through the water and turn on a dime with a flick of their tail. Researchers have been trying to achieve similar results with aquatic robots. In fact, one group in China has made progress using a flexible electromagnetic fin that propels an underwater robot at 405 millimeters—or 1.66 body lengths—per second. The team’s robotic swimmer can also make turns over just a 0.86 body-length radius.\nFanghao Zhou, an assistant professor at the State Key Laboratory of Ocean Sensing at Zhejiang University in Zhejiang, China, helped guide the research. Zhou notes that fish are agile, efficient, and adaptive—and robotically mimicking these qualities is a challenge.\n“Traditional robotic fins powered by motors can generate strong thrust, but they’re often bulky and rigid,” he says. “Soft actuators, on the other hand, are flexible but usually too weak to be practical. Our goal was to combine the best of both fields—a compact actuator that’s powerful yet flexible, like real muscle.”\nMaking a New Kind of Fin\nSo the research team designed a flexible electromagnetic fin with an elastic joint that swishes back and forth with little friction. It’s built with two small coils and spherical magnets. When alternating current flows through the coils, it creates an oscillating magnetic field that makes the fin flap back and forth, much like a fish’s tail. When the magnetic field isn’t oscillating, the fin returns to a neutral position at rest. \nIn their study, the researchers tested their bionic fin in a pool. Zhe Wang, a Ph.D. student in Zhou’s lab, emphasizes that the team not only successfully piloted the bionic fin in water, but they also built a mathematical model connecting electrical input to hydrodynamic thrust output. “That means we can predict how the fin will behave underwater just from the input current, which is rare in soft robotics,” he says. \n  A new robotic fish design reveals different swimming behaviors at different fin oscillation speeds.  Zhe Wang et al. \nIn their experiments, the researchers used a high-speed camera and precision force sensor to measure the trajectory of the fin and the thrust it generated—achieving a peak thrust of 0.493 newtons, despite the fin weighing just 17 grams. \nZhou notes the robotic system is small, lightweight, and powerful, and it will also be easy to scale into multi-fin systems. However, he adds that the current design consumes a lot of energy. “The electromagnetic coils draw a lot of current, so the swimming duration is relatively short,” he explains. “We are exploring ways to reduce energy loss, for example [by] optimizing coil geometry, using energy recovery circuits, and applying smart control strategies that don’t require continuous excitation.”\nThe researchers anticipate this robotic system could have a range of applications, including perhaps in underwater exploration, ecological monitoring, and inspection—such as safely interacting with coral reefs and marine life.\n“Our next step is to study multi-fin coordinated motion, enabling the robot to perform more flexible and lifelike swimming behaviors,” Wang says. “We are also exploring ways to improve energy efficiency, extend operation time, and further miniaturize the system for small autonomous underwater platforms.”\nThe researchers’ bionic fin is described in a study published 4 September in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "description": "Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were indicted in Brooklyn on charges that they conspired to illegally rig bets on pitches thrown during games. The two were charged with wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy, among other things. \nAccording to the indictment:\nThe defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types and speeds of pitches, and their co-conspirators used that inside information to place wagers on those pitches. In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments-funneled through third parties-in exchange for rigging pitches.\nThe scheme involved unnamed third-party bettors who allegedly earned over $400,000 on bets involving Clase and Ortiz. The pitchers, for their part, received kickbacks according to the indictment. In some instances, Clase and Ortiz even provided their coconspirators with money to fund the bets. \nTo organize the scheme, the two used their cellphones during games, which is prohibited by the MLB except under extenuating circumstances. The two are also facing a potential lifetime ban from the sport for violating the league’s rules against betting on their own games. \nHowever, if convicted, it’s unlikely they’d be released from prison while still young enough to compete anyway. Clase and Ortiz are facing a possible sentence of up to 65 years.",

And the resulting device, the Fire Phone, wound up more densely packed with big ideas than just about any gadget you'll find anywhere. There was just one tiny problem: they were mostly bad ideas.\nThe Fire Phone shipped in 2014 with a feature list a mile long. The screen had a 3D effect! There were, like, 400 cameras! There was a whole home screen filled with something called \"delighters!\" But the Fire Phone was, above all, a way to buy things on Amazon. That was what Bezos wanted, after all.

      "description": "Do the ornaments you adorn your Christmas tree with reflect you or your family’s interests? If not, maybe you should rectify that. We recently went hands on with Hallmark’s realistic Xbox 360 replica ornament, which plays a snippet of audio from Halo 3.

      "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $228 at Amazon\n $329.99 $228 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $89 at Nothing\n $109 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)\nThe second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExceptional ANC\nSecure fit\nWireless charging case\n\nBulky design\nMerely average battery life\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Bose\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\nRead our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah!

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features last year. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, in combination with better ANC performance, give the AirPods Pro 3 the best overall noise canceling from a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is incredibly close to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (although some people might not even notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, which we first saw with the Powerbeats Pro 2 last winter, enables heart rate tracking for 50 different types of workouts directly from the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. \nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $169 at Amazon\n $229 $169 at Best Buy\n $229 $169 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $149.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $149.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $299.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $299.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to add the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) and Apple AirPods Pro 3 as picks, and to reflect current pricing / availability.",

      "title": "IEEE WIE Podcast Focuses on Workplace Issues for Women in Tech",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech",
      "description": "For anyone working in today’s rapidly evolving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, visibility, authenticity, and connection are no longer optional; they are essential. But there is a lack of resources for STEM professionals, especially women, looking to express themselves fully, build meaningful networks, and lead with confidence.\nTo help, IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) recently launched a podcast series in which experts from around the world inspire and inform to ignite change.\nThe series aims to amplify the diverse experiences of women from STEM fields. Through candid conversations and expert insights, the podcast goes beyond technical talks to explore the human side of innovation, navigating burnout, balancing career ambition with well-being, and building successful, sustainable careers.\nThe series is a volunteer and staff-run initiative.\n“In the early days of planning, our vision was just a spark shared among passionate volunteers eager to shape each episode and guest experience,” says Geetika Tandon, cochair of the IEEE WIE podcast subcommittee. “Seeing our podcast grow from those first conversations into a vibrant reality has been truly rewarding. We can’t wait for it to expand further.”\n“I’m excited that we’ve brought the drawings on our whiteboard and day planners to life,” says Kelly Onu, who is also cochair.\nNew episodes are released on the third Wednesday of each month.\nNavigating dual-career dynamics\nThe podcast’s premier episode, “Moms Who Innovate,” which debuted in May, features candid conversations with two executive coaches, authors, and TEDx speakers. Adaeze Iloeje-Udeogalanya, is the founder of African Women in STEM, which provides education, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Cassie Leonard is a seasoned aerospace professional who founded ELMM Coaching. Leonard offers one-on-one advice for professionals looking to grow their career and achieve a better work-life balance. She authored STEM Moms: Design, Build, and Test to Create the Work-Life of Your Dreams, a book that guides women by drawing from her experiences as a working mother.\nOnu, who moderated the episode, spoke with Iloeje-Udeogalanya and Leonard about the ebb and flow of being a mother while building a career. Both guests described how their background as engineers shaped the way they approach motherhood and community. They emphasized the importance of creating a support system that makes the busier times of life more manageable.\nLeonard said she “engineered her neighborhood” and shares the responsibilities of dropping off children at school, babysitting after school, and other day-to-day tasks.\n“As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.” —Geetika Tandon\nInnovation for moms isn’t only about professional success, the duo said, but also about designing the kind of community that helps them thrive.\nThe June episode, “Global Perspectives on Women in STEM,” led by Tandon, offered practical strategies for navigating work-life-balance challenges. Together with guest Sanyogita Shamsunder, CTO of telecommunications company GeoLinks in San Francisco, Tandon explored different perspectives of women around the world.\nRawan Alghamdi, a wireless communication researcher at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, in Saudi Arabia, and an IEEE graduate student member hosted August’s episode, “PIE Framework: Presence, Image, and Exposure for Professionals in STEM.” Alghamdi spoke with Jahnavi Brenner, an executive coach and former engineer, who explained the PIE model, which challenges the long-held belief that technical skills alone are enough to advance one’s career.\nBrenner said professionals must strategically build an authentic personal brand to dictate how they are perceived by colleagues and how visible they are within their networks and industry. She said it is especially vital for women and underrepresented groups, who often face systemic barriers to recognition and promotion.\nOctober’s episode, “Balancing Work and Life in STEM Careers,” tackled struggles parents face raising a family while working full time. It was moderated by Abinaya Inbamani, a mentor who has contributed to the successful deployment of IoT systems used for smart health care, renewable energy, and cybersecurity.\nShe covered the intense logistics and emotional toll of balancing a demanding career with the responsibilities of parenthood.\nListeners also learned time-management strategies and boundary-setting techniques, such as reframing guilt as a reminder of care and responsibility rather than failure; accepting that it’s all right to procrastinate occasionally rather than push through unhealthy stress; and organizing the day with clear boundaries between work and home.\n“We don’t have to do it all,” Inbamani said. “Sometimes balance is simply choosing what matters most in that moment.” \nWhat’s next for the podcast\nUpcoming episodes will focus on being present parents, setting boundaries in high-pressure environments, and redefining success on one’s own terms, Tandon and Onu say.\nIn the works is an episode spotlighting tech trailblazer Nimisha Morkonda Gnanasekaran, who was recognized by the IEEE Computer Society as one of its Top 30 Early Career Professionals this year. She is the director of data science and advanced analytics at Western Digital, based in San Jose, Calif.\nAnother episode, Tandon and Onu say, will feature a conversation with Cynthia Kane, author of The Pause Principle: How to Keep Your Cool in Tough Situations, on navigating difficult workplace conversations without shutting down or losing one’s temper. The episode will tackle critical issues and career struggles women face, Tandon and Onu say. A study that found as many as 50 percent of women leave their STEM career within five years.\nGlobal reach and impact of the podcast\nIEEE WIE is seeing the impact the podcast is having on listeners. Several say they tune in not just for advice but also to connect with others. Others say the podcast makes them feel they are not alone in their challenges or career aspirations.\nThe majority of listeners are in Canada, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the United States. Onu says she hopes the audience expands to include more countries.\n“I hope this podcast hops across continents, sneaks into earbuds everywhere, and becomes a trusty sidekick in women’s STEM journeys—cheering them on as they conquer equations, break barriers, and maybe even invent a robot that makes perfect coffee,” Tandon says. “As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.”\nThrough personal tales, inspiring journeys, and a parade of trailblazing leaders who have tackled obstacles, IEEE WIE is celebrating the grit, wit, and brilliance of women in STEM.\nWhether you’re a student just beginning your STEM journey, a mid-career professional seeking clarity, or a leader looking to give back to your profession, the podcast offers a space to learn, reflect, and rise together.",

      "description": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nUnlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.\n\n[ HiPeR Lab ]\n\nI appreciate the softness of NEO’s design, but those fingers look awfully fragile.\n\n[ 1X ]\n\nImagine reaching into your backpack to find your keys. Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn’t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.\n\nMulti-university Collaboration presented via [ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nHappy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!\n\n[ Pollen Robotics ]\n\nIn collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling worm robot to test in the field. See it crawls through corrugated drainage pipes in a stream, and a smooth section of a subsurface drainage system.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Smart Microsystems Laboratory, Michigan State University ]\n\nHeterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments — uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps — subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.\n\n[ SPINE-HT ] from [ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania ]\n\nAstribot keeping itself busy at IROS 2025.\n\n[ Astribot ]\n\nIn two papers published in Matter and Advanced Science, a team of scientists from the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, developed control strategies for influencing the motion of self-propelling oil droplets. These oil droplets mimic single-celled microorganisms and can autonomously solve a complex maze by following chemical gradients. However, it is very challenging to integrate external perturbation and use these droplets in robotics. To address these challenges, the team developed magnetic droplets that still possess life-like properties and can be controlled by external magnetic fields. In their work, the researchers showed that they are able to guide the droplet’s motion and use them in microrobotic applications such as cargo transportation.\n\n[ Max Planck Institute ]\n\nEveryone has fantasized about having an embodied avatar! Full-body teleoperation and full-body data acquisition platform is waiting for you to try it out!\n\n[ Unitree ]\n\nIt’s not a humanoid, but it right now safely does useful things and probably doesn’t cost all that much to buy or run.\n\n[ Naver Labs ]\n\nThis paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus’. Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Autonomous Robots Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology ]\n\nHeavy payloads are no problem for it: The new KR TITAN ultra moves payloads of up to 1500 kg, making the heavy lifting extreme in the KUKA portfolio.\n\n[ Kuka ]\n\nGood luck getting all of the sand out of that robot. Perhaps a nice oil bath is in order?\n\n[ DEEP Robotics ]\n\nThis CMU RI Seminar is from Yuke Zhu at University of Texas at Austin, on “Toward Generalist Humanoid Robots: Recent Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges.”\n\nIn an era of rapid AI progress, leveraging accelerated computing and big data has unlocked new possibilities to develop generalist AI models. As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks? In this talk, I will outline our data-centric research principles and approaches for building general-purpose robot autonomy in the open world. I will present our recent work leveraging real-world, synthetic, and web data to train foundation models for humanoid robots. Furthermore, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges of building the next generation of intelligent robots.\n[ Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute ]",

      "title": "Co-Captain Allows Ships to Share Important Navigational Data",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ship-navigation-orca-ai",
      "description": "A new onboard system allows ocean-going vessels to share real-time sea condition data, giving crews early warnings and helping them navigate more safely. The system will analyze data related to navigation, vessel behavior, and the environment to give ship crews guidance at sea.\nWhile casualties from ship collisions and groundings have declined, the overall number of maritime incidents are on the rise, up 22 percent in recent years, driven by aging vessels and equipment failures.\nOrca AI, a London-based autonomous maritime navigation company, has introduced a software feature called Co-Captain, aiming to reduce those incidents. Co-Captain is an addition to the company’s existing SeaPod real-time decision support system, which bridge officers can use while at sea to navigate better.\n  Co-Captain provides information about severe weather, including recommendations to specific ships based on their size and shape.Orca AI\n“Co-Captain is a network of vessels using Orca to capture events worldwide and share insights. Think of it like the navigation app you use in your car: it tells you about traffic or roadblocks in advance so you can adjust your route,” says Yarden Gross, the CEO and co-founder of Orca AI.\nGross says that Co-Captain frequently collects data from sensors on board vessels and sends it to the cloud to improve ship performance and safety for vessels globally.\nOrca AI’s Maritime Solutions\nOrcaAI, founded in 2018 by Gross and Dor Raviv, the CTO, began with SeaPod and Fleet View. While SeaPod collects and analyzes data on individual ships, Fleet View gathers that data in the cloud to give fleet managers on shore better visibility into larger operations.\nCo-Captain integrates with the existing system to provide proactive insights to improve fleet performance and safety. Today, ship officers rely on tools like radar, the automatic identification system (AIS), and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) monitor the positions of other vessels and avoid collisions, but much of the work remains manual.\n  Co-Captain identifies various navigational hazards to a ship’s crew. The crew can also manually tag obstacles or other concerns.Orca AI\nGross described Co-Captain as the next generation of AIS, the network that transmits basic information like a ship’s position, name, and heading over very high frequency (VHF) signals ranging from 30 to 300 megahertz. Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship’s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels’ crews.\n“Every ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node—the vessel itself—has an onboard AI platform. This platform collects data from multiple sensors in real time,” Gross says. Using cameras and computer vision, the AI model can detect bad weather, low visibility, tall waves, or strong winds, then the platform analyzes the data to provide tailored guidance.\nAll data is anonymized. Gross says that a ship’s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. “By anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.”\nGross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.\nThe company’s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship’s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations. The platform is already in use on over 1,200 vessels.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/evs-keep-homes-lit",
      "description": "In Menifee, Calif., six newly built homes are testing a first for North America: electric vehicles that can power houses through the Combined Charging System (CCS) high-power DC charging standard. Each home uses a host Kia EV9 electric vehicle connected to a Wallbox Quasar 2 bidirectional charger, allowing the car’s 100-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery to run essential circuits during blackouts or periods when electricity prices are high. The setup is the first residential vehicle-to-home (V2H) system in the United States that uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. The CCS is the charging system commonly used in European and North American residential and public charging facilities.\nSince July, the homes’ smart electrical panels have automatically managed two-way power flow—charging vehicles from the grid or rooftop solar, then reversing the flow of energy when needed. The system isolates each home from the grid during an outage, preventing any current from flowing into external power lines and endangering utility crews and nearby equipment.\n“This project is demonstrating that bidirectional charging with CCS can work in occupied homes,” says Scott Samuelsen, founding director of the Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP) at the University of California, Irvine, which is monitoring the two-year trial. “It’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people but also strengthen the energy system.”\nMenifee means a lot\nFor more than a decade, two-way charging has been available—but mostly restricted to Japan. Back in 2012 the Nissan’s LEAF-to-Home program proved the idea viable after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but that Nissan system relied on the CHAdeMO standard, little used outside of Japan. Most North American and European manufacturers chose CCS instead—a standard that, until recently, supported only one-way fast DC charging.\nThat distinction makes Menifee’s V2H-enabled neighborhood notable: it’s the first CCS-based V2H deployment in occupied homes, giving researchers real-world field data on a technology that’s been long trapped in pilot programs. The pairing of the Kia EV9 SUV with Wallbox’s commercially available Quasar 2 can deliver up to 12 kilowatts of power from the vehicle to the home.\nIt’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people, but also strengthen the energy system.”\n –Scott Samuelsen, UC Irvine\n\nElsewhere, momentum towards commercial V2H has slowed. Ford’s F-150 Lightning supports home backup through Sunrun, but Sunrun equipment is not CCS-compatible. What’s more, Ford has announced a production pause for the pickup truck, which has delayed expansion. GM’s Ultium Home—a  V2H system that works with the automaker’s Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra EVs— faces similar setbacks. Tesla’s PowerShare V2H feature is still stuck in a limited, early commercial rollout, with bidirectional compatibility restricted to the company’s Cybertruck. Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.\nWhy CCS Matters\nWhen electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).\nBidirectional operation wasn’t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS’s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations—ISO 15118—didn’t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, ISO 15118-20, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.\nWallbox’s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its 12-kW power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says Aleix Maixé Sas, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.\n  As the company’s name humbly suggests, Wallbox’s chargers look like plain old boxes—although they contain high-tech components.Wallbox\nThe Menifee blueprint\nEach of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh SunVault stationary battery from SunPower. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9’s battery. When the grid fails—or when energy prices spike—the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.\nThis past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that “the vehicle adds a major resilience feature,” according to Samuelsen, who is the Menifee project manager. “It can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.”\nEngineering the Two-Way Home\nHome builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.\nA Glimpse of the Energy Future\nAnalysts expect double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee’s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.\nWhen EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear—and with it, old concepts regarding who’s an energy supplier and who’s a customer.",

Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free!\nAt its core, engineering is an act of creation. This is why many of us chose to become engineers: We love to build things.\nBut especially if you have a private sector job, it’s easy to forget that passion to build as you climb up the corporate ladder. Somewhere between quarterly planning meetings and incident retrospectives, we often lose the joy of creation in our corporate jobs. Large companies require a level of bureaucracy and specialization that is often at odds with building something new.\nThat’s why I frequently recommend burned-out engineers to do something very simple: Start a side project. During 15 years working across various tech stacks and companies, this has been the most straightforward, underrated, and powerful way to regain my excitement at work.\nBeyond rekindling a passion for creation, side projects have many other benefits. Side projects let us explore new technologies or problem spaces. We can leverage newer ideas that our companies may be hesitant to adopt. And you don’t need to get buy-in from a manager or explain the business justification. Start using a technology simply because you want to learn about it. \nWhen you build something through a side project, your depth of understanding is far greater than just following a tutorial or reading about it. I can attribute many of my career opportunities to the projects I’ve built and published outside of my day job. Some of these projects, like my career growth platform Taro, even turn into companies!\nWe’ve entered the golden age for side projects because they’re so much more accessible. Compared to a decade ago, it’s significantly easier to research, build, and deploy your creation. Even compared to two years ago, you’re much less likely now to waste hours wrestling with some configuration rabbit hole. Just ask ChatGPT or Gemini for help!\nThe benefits of a personal project are real: passion, learning, career growth, and fun. And they’re easier than ever to create. Now’s the time to create your side project portfolio.\n—Rahul\nHow to Land a Job in Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry is growing, opening up new opportunities for engineers—and you don’t necessarily need a background in quantum physics to take these positions. So what skills do you need?

It is given to those who have achieved outstanding business results while demonstrating the company’s values.\nGupta also became an invited member of the Forbes Technology Council, a community of experienced leaders across industries, selected based on their professional achievements and leadership experience.\nHe says he enjoys his job but says he never meant to work in financial services, a field where he has built a nearly two-decade-long career.\nFrom electrical engineering to software development\nAs a youngster, he was curious about how things worked and would take apart gadgets his father brought home.\n“My father worked at BSNL, a government telecom organization, and often took me to his office,” Gupta says. “There I would watch phones in operation and telecom operators connecting trunk calls. At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.”\nWhile at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.\nTaking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.\n“Growing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the Bamleshwari Temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,” he says.\nHe also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory’s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.\n“I noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,” he says. “This exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.”\nIn 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the Christian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.\nIn India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company Satyam Computer Services, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor’s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.\nThat’s when he pivoted to software engineering.\nGupta says that although software development wasn’t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.\nHe still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn’t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.\nHis time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.\n“It’s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,” he says.\nUsing AI and machine learning to combat fraud\nGupta left Satyam in 2011 to join Mphasis, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for Wipro Technologies in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.\nHe moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at JPMorgan Chase in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank’s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.\n“This greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,” he says.\nHe also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.\n“I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.”\n“This allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,” he says. “These innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.”\nHe joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.\nAI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer’s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.\nIn simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.\nStaying connected to tech pros\nGupta joined IEEE in 2023 “to connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,” he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.\n“Membership has helped me access world-class research through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library,” he says. “It also provided me an opportunity to attend conferences and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.”\nAI’s impact on engineering\nHis advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.\n“Technology is changing very rapidly,” he says. “What is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.”\nHe predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.\n“Engineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,” he says. “I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\n“Focus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.\n“Build your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.”",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "title": "Inside the Massive Effort to Sequence All of Europe’s Lepidoptera",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/lepidoptera-genome-sequencing",
      "description": "It’s a little after 6:30 on a brisk July morning in a stone hut high in the Italian Alps. A gently hissing wood fire is leaking some warmth out of a brick oven. Gathered near it, around a big wooden table, some of Europe’s brightest young lepidopterists are doing what they do best: arguing in Spanish, Italian, and English about moths.\n The Alte Pforzheimer Hütte, a stone house originally built in 1901, served as a base camp for the lepidopterists hunting rare moths in the Italian Alps.Luigi Avantaggiato\nScattered across the top of the table are dozens of moths in plastic specimen jars, the harvest of the previous night’s trapping. At one end of the table, Gioele Moro of the Czech Academy of Sciences is gently prying loose moths from the depths of a trap. At the other end, Laura Torrado-Blanco of the University of Oviedo’s entomological collection is paging through Lepidoptera guide books. She’s using the books to identify species—up here at 2,300 meters, there is no Internet connection.\n A few of the scores of moths captured on a single night at a site in the Italian Alps are lined up on a bench in the stone hut. Researchers will identify the moths’ species and some of the insects will be sent on for tissue sampling and eventual genome sequencing. Luigi Avantaggiato\nLooking up from a book, she notices me noticing the big butterfly tattoo on her left arm. “Chapman’s ringlet,” she tells me. “Erebia palarica,” she adds reflexively.\nPep Lancho Silva, a doctoral student at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, extends a finger toward me with a spectacular creature on it: a large bone-white moth, with a black head and big black splotches on its wings. Torrado-Blanco is pretty sure it’s Arctia flavia, a species of tiger moth found only in rarefied air. If so, it’s precisely the kind of insect they came up here, to this chilly hut on the edge of a crystalline Alpine pond, to capture.\n A yellow tiger moth, Arctia flavia, is among the catch at the stone hut, at an altitude of 2,300 meters. \n At the crack of dawn in the stone hut, researchers [from left] Eric Toro Delgado, Laura Torrado-Blanco, Mónica Doblas-Bajo, and Gioele Moro (standing) unpack and examine the moths captured during the previous night.Luigi Avantaggiato\nLepidopterists have trapped, identified, and classified moths and butterflies for centuries. But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It’s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of Project Psyche, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. Psyche is part of a larger effort, the Darwin Tree of Life project, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the Earth BioGenome Project. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of all of Earth’s roughly 1.8 million organisms—every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that’s made up of cells that have a nucleus.\nRelated: The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything\nNone of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it’s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal—to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035—won’t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.\n\n\n\nBut the project’s success may ultimately hinge on functions other than sequencing. For example, after a creature’s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data—consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs—must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, before an organism’s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it’s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.\nHow Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? \nWhen I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to Charlotte Wright and Joana Meier at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, England. The reasons, they tell me, span a range from pure science to completely commercial.\n \n At the Hotel Tyrol in the Italian Alps, lepidopterist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, dissects the yellow tiger moth captured near the stone hut. Packed with liquid nitrogen, the tissue samples will subsequently be sent to the institute in England for genome sequencing.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe earliest Lepidoptera appeared 250 million to 300 million years ago. By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, “we can find out how they have evolved and how they’ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.”\nThose genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell’s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature’s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the Atlas blue butterfly, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.\nThe Atlas blue is “a very good example of something that’s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,” says Meier. “What we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications”—thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. “Then we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, ‘What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that’s broken?’ ”\n Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.Luigi Avantaggiato\nAnd it’s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data. One practical aspect of these studies has to do with moths’ impact on agriculture. “There’s billions and billions of euros lost because agriculturally, some species do a lot of damage,” says Meier.\nAdds Wright, “Pests are moving to new regions where previously they weren’t present and causing huge losses because the crops there haven’t been developed to be protected against these new species.” The reasons why some species succeed in a new area as climate changes, and are able to adapt and thrive, are also understandable only by studying many genomes—of the creatures that succeed, as well as the ones that don’t. “It’s kind of a dynamic situation, of monitoring these pests’ movements,” says Wright.\n  Shortly before sunset, Gioele Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, sets up a moth trap on a mountain slope above the stone hut (the Alte Pforzheimer Hütte) in the Italian Alps.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \nThat, it turns out, takes a small army of grad students, researchers, and even citizen-scientists. Indeed, one of the goals of this expedition is to develop and refine best practices in collecting samples for genome sequencing and to train a cadre of young lepidopterists, who have varying levels of familiarity with the technologies of genome sequencing and annotation. On such techniques rests the success of not only Project Psyche, but also, ultimately, the Earth BioGenome Project.\nTo Catch a Moth, You’ve Got to Think Like One\nIt’s late in the afternoon of our first day in the high-altitude hut. Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, is standing on a steeply raked mountainside in a dazzling sea of wildflowers—purple, yellow, lavender, crimson—that are gently swaying in the fading amber light. He’s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he’s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it’s black). He’s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth’s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.\nThe objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different “microenvironments,” he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there’s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.\n  Genetics researcher Noé Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \n“Over there”—he points across the valley to the opposite slope. “It faces north. See? No flowers. That’s what I mean by different microenvironments.” We’re perched on the south-facing slope, about 80 meters above the valley bottom, on a trail about as wide as a toaster oven.\nHours later, after dodging cow patties the size of dinner plates and gaping holes leading to marmot burrows, the locations are chosen and the traps are set. There’s one on the south slope, one on the north, and one near the fast-flowing stream between them. As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.\nAt the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night’s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they’ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The Wellcome Trust is the lead sponsor of both Project Psyche and the Darwin Tree of Life project.\n \n  Lepidopterist Joana Meier of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, packs the abdomen of a moth into a vial for shipment from Italy to the institute in England. A bar code on the vial contains information about the sample and allows it to be tracked on its journey to the lab. Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe plastic tubes are packed in liquid-nitrogen-cooled shipping containers for the trip to Wellcome Sanger. DNA begins to break down almost immediately after death, especially in soft tissues. So the cryogenics are necessary to ensure that the samples arrive at Wellcome Sanger with as little degradation as possible.\nMicromoths Are a Looming Challenge \nNiklas Wahlberg of Lund University, in Sweden, is officially a “sampling hub leader” of Project Psyche. Unofficially, he’s one of the select few grizzled veterans here in Malles Venosta helping to mentor the young researchers, whose attendance is being funded through a European Union program called European Cooperation in Science and Technology.\n  Niklas Wahlberg, an evolutionary biologist at Lund University in Sweden, captures a moth in a plastic container at a trapping site along an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nWahlberg is an unabashed fan of moths. It’s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it’s just that he’s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can’t even fly at night or in the rain. “Butterflies are just day-flying moths,” Wahlberg quips. “People think of them as different and special, but they’re not.”\nIn this new era of mass genome sequencing, they’re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera—about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 European Lepidoptera species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg’s reckoning. And they’ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.\nSo the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the micromoths.\nMicromoths have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; the smallest can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as “macromoths”). There are a lot of micromoths—at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.\n  Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThat’s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes. Fortunately, though, it’s a problem for which there is a technological solution: DNA barcoding.\nBesides the DNA in the nuclei of every cell, there exists other genetic material, called mitochondrial DNA, outside of the nucleus. It’s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there’s a mitochondrial gene, called CO1, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. “We have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,” Wahlberg says. “And only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.”\nDNA barcoding was invented in the early 2000s by Paul Hebert and colleagues at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.\n \n  Staﬀ Scientist Silvia Pérez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing. To minimize degradation of the DNA in the samples, they are stored at -80 °C.Luigi Avantaggiato\nGenetic material is isolated from that tissue, and then a CO1 gene is “amplified,” or replicated into many millions of copies, using a standard biotechnical technique called polymerase chain reaction. That material is sequenced using any one of the dozen or more types of sequencing machines available to researchers.\nFor barcoding purposes, typical DNA sequences of the CO1 gene run between 400 and 800 base pairs. But lately researchers have been developing techniques that use shorter or longer barcodes. The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have 100 to 250 base pairs. Conversely, “super-barcodes,” which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species—exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.\nWhy RNA Will Make Annotating Faster\nWhile the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project. Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly, Lycaena helle, a creature that was first studied in 1775. They described their efforts in a paper published by F1000Research.\nThis was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome’s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.\n  Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.Luigi Avantaggiato\nToday, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the thousands of genes within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. “You take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, ‘Ah, look here. There’s a gene that starts here,” says Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG), in Barcelona. “ ‘And this is the structure of the gene.’ And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,” of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.\nGut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or ribonucleic acid. When a gene specifies, or “expresses,” a protein, RNA acts as the “messenger,” carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.\nThe breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article “The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything, in IEEE Spectrum.”] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations—CNAG, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at Pompeu Fabra University, and the University of Barcelona—and from Andorra Research and Innovation, in Sant Julià de Lòria.\nThe genome of the female violet copper butterfly, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also very difficult to predict by computational means. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says Roderic Guigó Serra, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.\n“Long-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,” he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, “we get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,” Serra declares.\n  At the Guigò Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. Luigi Avantaggiato\nHis group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species—including humans. They’re doing this through Gencode, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, “reference” annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it—particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying 18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes. “These genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,” says Serra.\nResearchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world’s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe’s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.\nIt’s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. “My loathings are simple,” he wrote in 1973. “Stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music. My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing and butterfly hunting.”",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "title": "Volcanologists Turn to a High-Tech Suitcase to Study Eruptions",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/volcano-monitoring-stromboli-skate",
      "description": "When hundreds of volcanologists gathered in Geneva last July for the world’s largest volcanology conference, Italy’s Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) drew particular attention. INGV was presenting results from five years of very close range observations of Stromboli, one of the Mediterranean’s most monitored volcanoes. Its frequent small eruptions make it both a natural laboratory for vulcanologists and a constant safety concern for the island’s roughly 500 residents and thousands of tourists.\nThe last three years of close observations were made possible by a portable observatory called the Setup for the Kinematic Acquisition of Explosive Eruptions, or SKATE. The suitcase-sized system is packed with tech that captures eruptions at hundreds of frames per second, synchronously recording their roar and their heat.\nFilming and analyzing an explosive eruption up close for hours, while capturing data about its heat, sound, and motion, has historically been tricky and dangerous. But that’s the data scientists need to understand how eruptions work and evolve over time. SKATE makes that process both safer and simpler by autonomously recording synchronized streams of observatory data and minimizing the time researchers need to spend on a volcano’s slopes.\n“Explosive eruptions are extremely fast processes with particles the size of a truck or a grain of dust that can travel from a few meters per second to supersonic speeds,” says Jacopo Taddeucci, a senior researcher at INGV. “You need cameras shooting hundreds of frames per second and instruments that can see, hear, and feel the eruption at once to understand cause and effect.”\nAside from Stromboli, SKATE has been tested on the nearby Mount Etna, as well as on Guatemala’s Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live near active volcanoes, many of which are without any monitoring system. INGV is now planning deployments on other volcanoes, including Mount Yasur in Vanuatu, known as the “Lighthouse of the Pacific” for its near continuous eruptions featuring rhythmic bursts of incandescent lava and gas.\nSKATE’s Innovative Volcanology Technology\nSKATE was assembled by Technology Equipment Engineering Solutions (TEES), an Italian manufacturer of custom scientific instruments and Dewesoft, a Slovenian company specializing in high-speed data acquisition and measurement systems. The two companies followed INGV’s specifications to pack an entire observatory into a rigid polypropylene shell on a €50,000 (about US $58,000) budget.\nSKATE is the streamlined successor to an earlier INGV prototype known as FAMoUS (Fast Multiparametric Setup), which first proved the value of combining high-speed, thermal, and acoustic sensors. But it also came with serious drawbacks: It was heavy and bulky, took a long time to install on site, and required manual triggering, which forced researchers to spend hours in hazardous zones to capture only a handful of sequences.\n  SKATE is more portable and easier to deploy than its predecessor, a system called FAMoUS.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nInside SKATE, a waterproof PC coordinates a thermal camera recording at 32 frames per second, and a high-speed camera that records bursts of footage when it detects sudden temperature spikes. Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE’s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.\n“The real challenge wasn’t plugging in cameras and sensors,” says Alessia Longo, an engineer at Dewesoft. “It was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.”\nThat data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on solar panels and replaceable batteries.\n“The creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,” says Piergiorgio Scarlato, INGV’s research director.\nModular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring\nPlaced between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli’s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. \nThe design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify sulfur dioxide emissions. It’s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano’s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.\n“Depth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,” says Scarlato “By understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.”\nOn Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs—chunks of lava flung out during an eruption—and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.\nSKATE’s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis\nSKATE isn’t a 24/7 alarm. It’s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater—such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments—to make better sense of their signals.\n  A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nData from SKATE is helping scientists test hypotheses about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can’t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.\nSKATE’s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent research campaign on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli’s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.\nDespite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. “Working in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,” says Scarlato. “The difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.”",

      "title": "Novel Geothermal System to Come Online in Germany",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/advanced-geothermal-germany",
      "description": "This article was originally published by Canary Media.\nEavor, an advanced-geothermal startup, says it has significantly reduced drilling times and improved technologies at its nearly online project in Germany—milestones that should help it drive down the costs of harnessing clean energy from the ground.\nIn late October, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel “closed-loop” geothermal systems in hotter and deeper locations than conventional projects can access.\n“Much like wind and solar have come down the cost curve, much like unconventional shale [oil and gas] have come down the cost curve, we now have a technical proof-point that we’ve done that in Europe,” Jeanine Vany, a cofounder and executive vice president of corporate affairs at Eavor, said from the Geothermal Rising conference in Reno, Nevada.\nEavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms—including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy—are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.\nThe industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.\nEavor’s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany \nEavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund. For its first “loop,” the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly 2.8 miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells—like tines of a fork—that each stretch 1.8 miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.\nOperations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March 2026. All told, the system will supply 8.2 megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and 64 MW of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. \nIn its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 100 days to complete—a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $100,000 a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by 50 percent.\nFor example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.\nOn top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35 percent, Vany said.\nThe Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches—like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada—are also scaling up.\nChallenges in Geothermal Drilling\nEnhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater—though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.\nBut the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.\n“While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,” Tester said. “You can get energy out of the ground; it’s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?”\nVany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the “levelized cost of heat” in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $50 and $100 per megawatt-hour thermal in the region’s volatile energy market, she said.\n“After we’ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,” Vany added. “And that’s the purpose of the Geretsried project.”",
