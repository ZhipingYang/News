      "description": "Let’s skip the polite throat-clearing. Your “AI platform” is a vending machine that hands out root on layaway. Agents hoard long-lived API keys, plugins ship with mystery meat, and every “secure” gateway rubber-stamps bearer tokens like it’s still 2011. Then you’re shocked when a prompt tells your agent to exfiltrate S3. Adorable.\nYou don’t need another dreamy “AI safety” framework. You need a bouncer with a working flashlight. Check IDs and the bag. That’s it. That’s the post.\nTool creds living forever in agent memory, logs, and “debug mode.”\nPrompt injection turns “helpful assistant” into “unpaid red team.”\nMulti-agent graphs swapping capabilities like baseball cards.\nRevocation that’s a Slack message and a prayer.\nTransport TLS solves exactly none of that. It’s a pipe. Great pipe. Wrong layer.\nCall it “TLS for AI agents” if marketing needs a sticker. The real shape:\nAttest → Mint → Use → Freeze.\nShort-lived, scoped credentials (Agent Entitlement Credentials, AECs).\nOffline verifiers at tool boundaries\nCo-signed TRANSFER for delegation\nFREEZE with a clock, not vibes\n“TLS for Agents” Mapping (So The CIO Nods And Signs)\nCerts → AECs (short-lived, environment-bound)\n\nHandshake → Mint Gate + Policy (prove PoP + measured runtime)\n\nmTLS → Mutual Verification (gateway checks AEC + proofs)\n\nCRL/OCSP → FREEZE + freshness (deterministic revocation)\n\nCT logs → Custody ledger (append-only, lineage + co-signed transfers)\n\nWhere it’s stronger than TLS: authorization is baked in (allowlists, datasets), delegation is safe (co-signed, monotonic), and revocation is time-bounded. Where the analogy stops: this is capability issuance and enforcement, not a wire cipher suite.\nStatic keys in agents. Torched.\nPrompt-induced tool sprawl. Gateways read the tool_allowlist claim. Out-of-policy calls bounce.\nShadow plugin superpowers. Plugins are custodians; installs mint scoped AECs only if the plugin build attests to approved digests. Freeze the plugin, brick the power—everywhere.\n“We couldn’t reach the issuer.” Don’t care. Proofs are offline. Decide locally.\nAgent boots inside a measured container. Emits attestation: image hash, model ID, prompt template commit, dataset snapshot IDs.\nMint AEC with claims: env_digest, tool_allowlist, dataset_snapshot, policy_version, lineage_hash, freeze_epoch, short TTL.\nTool gateway validates AEC + proof bundle offline. Denies any call not on the allowlist or stale by freshness.\nTrigger FREEZE(plugin=“reports-writer”). Show that calls fail across the fleet within the promised p95 window. No “please reboot the agent.” No “clear your cache.”\nAttestation schema (keep it boring & strict):\nToken binding:\nDelegation:\nRevocation math:\nSOC2 candy:\n“But our gateway runs mTLS!”\n“This is just CT + OIDC?”\n“Won’t this slow us down?”\nKill the long-lived keys. No exceptions. Every “temporary” bypass becomes permanent. Every permanent key becomes an incident postmortem with your name on it.\nYou don’t need another guardrail deck. You need a door that doesn’t argue. Evidence → policy → token → go. Change the bag? Prove it again. Drop the bag? You’re out. Misbehave? Freeze, everywhere, on a clock.\nCall it “TLS for AI agents” if it helps sales. Under the hood it’s attestation-gated, custody-tracked, offline-verifiable capability issuance. Which is exactly what your agents should have had before you let them anywhere near prod.\nNow either wire the gate, or keep explaining to the board why the chatbot had write access to payroll.",

      "description": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nUnlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.\n\n[ HiPeR Lab ]\n\nI appreciate the softness of NEO’s design, but those fingers look awfully fragile.\n\n[ 1X ]\n\nImagine reaching into your backpack to find your keys. Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn’t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.\n\nMulti-university Collaboration presented via [ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nHappy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!\n\n[ Pollen Robotics ]\n\nIn collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling worm robot to test in the field. See it crawls through corrugated drainage pipes in a stream, and a smooth section of a subsurface drainage system.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Smart Microsystems Laboratory, Michigan State University ]\n\nHeterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments — uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps — subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.\n\n[ SPINE-HT ] from [ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania ]\n\nAstribot keeping itself busy at IROS 2025.\n\n[ Astribot ]\n\nIn two papers published in Matter and Advanced Science, a team of scientists from the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, developed control strategies for influencing the motion of self-propelling oil droplets. These oil droplets mimic single-celled microorganisms and can autonomously solve a complex maze by following chemical gradients. However, it is very challenging to integrate external perturbation and use these droplets in robotics. To address these challenges, the team developed magnetic droplets that still possess life-like properties and can be controlled by external magnetic fields. In their work, the researchers showed that they are able to guide the droplet’s motion and use them in microrobotic applications such as cargo transportation.\n\n[ Max Planck Institute ]\n\nEveryone has fantasized about having an embodied avatar! Full-body teleoperation and full-body data acquisition platform is waiting for you to try it out!\n\n[ Unitree ]\n\nIt’s not a humanoid, but it right now safely does useful things and probably doesn’t cost all that much to buy or run.\n\n[ Naver Labs ]\n\nThis paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus’. Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Autonomous Robots Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology ]\n\nHeavy payloads are no problem for it: The new KR TITAN ultra moves payloads of up to 1500 kg, making the heavy lifting extreme in the KUKA portfolio.\n\n[ Kuka ]\n\nGood luck getting all of the sand out of that robot. Perhaps a nice oil bath is in order?\n\n[ DEEP Robotics ]\n\nThis CMU RI Seminar is from Yuke Zhu at University of Texas at Austin, on “Toward Generalist Humanoid Robots: Recent Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges.”\n\nIn an era of rapid AI progress, leveraging accelerated computing and big data has unlocked new possibilities to develop generalist AI models. As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks? In this talk, I will outline our data-centric research principles and approaches for building general-purpose robot autonomy in the open world. I will present our recent work leveraging real-world, synthetic, and web data to train foundation models for humanoid robots. Furthermore, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges of building the next generation of intelligent robots.\n[ Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute ]",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "title": "Robotic Fish Zips Through Water With Flexible Electromagnetic Fin",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robot-electromagnetic-fin",
      "description": "This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore.\nFish are able to dart quickly through the water and turn on a dime with a flick of their tail. Researchers have been trying to achieve similar results with aquatic robots. In fact, one group in China has made progress using a flexible electromagnetic fin that propels an underwater robot at 405 millimeters—or 1.66 body lengths—per second. The team’s robotic swimmer can also make turns over just a 0.86 body-length radius.\nFanghao Zhou, an assistant professor at the State Key Laboratory of Ocean Sensing at Zhejiang University in Zhejiang, China, helped guide the research. Zhou notes that fish are agile, efficient, and adaptive—and robotically mimicking these qualities is a challenge.\n“Traditional robotic fins powered by motors can generate strong thrust, but they’re often bulky and rigid,” he says. “Soft actuators, on the other hand, are flexible but usually too weak to be practical. Our goal was to combine the best of both fields—a compact actuator that’s powerful yet flexible, like real muscle.”\nMaking a New Kind of Fin\nSo the research team designed a flexible electromagnetic fin with an elastic joint that swishes back and forth with little friction. It’s built with two small coils and spherical magnets. When alternating current flows through the coils, it creates an oscillating magnetic field that makes the fin flap back and forth, much like a fish’s tail. When the magnetic field isn’t oscillating, the fin returns to a neutral position at rest. \nIn their study, the researchers tested their bionic fin in a pool. Zhe Wang, a Ph.D. student in Zhou’s lab, emphasizes that the team not only successfully piloted the bionic fin in water, but they also built a mathematical model connecting electrical input to hydrodynamic thrust output. “That means we can predict how the fin will behave underwater just from the input current, which is rare in soft robotics,” he says. \n  A new robotic fish design reveals different swimming behaviors at different fin oscillation speeds.  Zhe Wang et al. \nIn their experiments, the researchers used a high-speed camera and precision force sensor to measure the trajectory of the fin and the thrust it generated—achieving a peak thrust of 0.493 newtons, despite the fin weighing just 17 grams. \nZhou notes the robotic system is small, lightweight, and powerful, and it will also be easy to scale into multi-fin systems. However, he adds that the current design consumes a lot of energy. “The electromagnetic coils draw a lot of current, so the swimming duration is relatively short,” he explains. “We are exploring ways to reduce energy loss, for example [by] optimizing coil geometry, using energy recovery circuits, and applying smart control strategies that don’t require continuous excitation.”\nThe researchers anticipate this robotic system could have a range of applications, including perhaps in underwater exploration, ecological monitoring, and inspection—such as safely interacting with coral reefs and marine life.\n“Our next step is to study multi-fin coordinated motion, enabling the robot to perform more flexible and lifelike swimming behaviors,” Wang says. “We are also exploring ways to improve energy efficiency, extend operation time, and further miniaturize the system for small autonomous underwater platforms.”\nThe researchers’ bionic fin is described in a study published 4 September in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "title": "Spider-Inspired Microbots Could Replace Invasive Gut Diagnostics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-pill-sized-robot-cartwheel",
      "description": "Deadly intestinal cancers are on the rise, and the best chance to beat them is with an early diagnosis. But current techniques used to inspect the digestive tract are highly invasive, scaring many patients away. Some researchers hope that soft, magnetically controlled robots the size of a vitamin capsule could replace these diagnostic methods in a few short years.\nA team led by Qingsong Xu, a professor of electromechanical engineering at the University of Macau in China, recently unveiled a micro-robot prototype inspired by the locomotion of an African spider that cartwheels across the desert dunes of Namibia instead of crawling. \nThe robot, made of a rubber-like magnetic material, has been tested in animal stomachs, colons, and small intestines. The researchers said it successfully navigated the “complex environment” of the digestive tract, full of mucus, sharp turns, and obstacles as tall as 8 centimeters high. \nToday’s procedures use endoscopes, flexible tubes fitted with a camera that doctors insert into the patient’s digestive tracts through the mouth or rectum. The procedure requires sedation due to the extreme discomfort it causes to the patient, and improper manipulation with the endoscope can cause serious injuries, including bowel perforation. Some patients might delay the investigation out of fear, which could have catastrophic consequences as cancer might spread. Other diseases, such as stomach ulcers and Crohn’s disease are also diagnosed with endoscopy.\n“Traditional endoscopes cause a lot of discomfort and cannot easily access complex deeper regions inside the body,” Xu told IEEE Spectrum. “The purpose of the soft magnetic robot is to provide a minimally invasive, controllable, and highly flexible alternative.”\nHow the Robot Moves\nSoft magnetic robots, like that developed by Xu, offer a more palatable alternative to endoscopy. The robot, the size of a large vitamin capsule, could be swallowed with relative ease and pass through the stomach and the entire length of the small and large intestines, propelled by an externally applied magnetic field. The robotic mini-spider could perform detailed inspections of the complicated terrain without bothering the patient too much. At the end of its journey, it passes out of the body just like processed food.\nOther teams have experimented with various types of robot locomotion, including crawling, jumping, and swimming, the researchers said in a paper describing the new robot, published in the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing last month. Those earlier designs, however, had limitations when traversing such complex environments as the digestive tract. \n  These series of images show how the robot moves through the stomach. In the rightmost column, the researchers also demonstrate targeted drug delivery. Ruomeng Xu, Xianli Wang, et al.\n“We went for a design inspired by the golden wheel spider, because it provided superior obstacle crossing ability and energy efficiency compared to other locomotion models,” Xu said. “By mimicking this type of locomotion in the patient, the robot can navigate in the mucus, in the folded and even vertically inclined surfaces with remarkable stability.”\nThe golden wheel spider is a small arachnid, about 2 centimeters wide, that escapes danger by curling its legs around its body and rolling down the sloping desert dunes. The robot developed by the Macau team uses the same strategy, but instead of being propelled by gravity, it rolls through the digestive tract thanks to an external magnetic force that interacts with tiny magnets in the robot’s legs. To control the robot with precision, the researchers created a dexterous robotic arm fitted with a powerful rotating magnet that sits next to the patient during the procedure.\nThe Future of Gut Diagnostics\nThe researchers plan to perform further experiments with live animals and, if all goes well, move to clinical trials with humans. Xu hopes the soft spider robots could help doctors examine patients’ insides in as little as five years. \n“The medical community increasingly recognizes the potential of soft magnetic robots to revolutionize endoscopic procedures by minimizing patient discomfort and increasing precision,” said Xu. “There is a lot of interest in the medical world.”\nIn the not-so-distant future, advances in micro-robotics may enable targeted drug delivery in the treatment of ulcers or tumors. The tiny robots could also be used in a range of minimally invasive interventions and examinations. The field has been growing rapidly in the past few years, although no such robots have yet made it into clinical practice, and magnetically controlled robots are a promising field of development many researchers are exploring.\nFor example, a team from North Carolina State University recently presented another such robot, also using a flexible magnetic material. Instead of cartwheeling, the North Carolina robot crawls through the digestive tract like a caterpillar; the external magnetic forces induce contractions in its 3D-printed origami-style structure. A paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials described experiments with the robot delivering mock treatment to a mock stomach ulcer. \nXiaomeng Fang, assistant professor in material engineering at North Carolina State University and lead author of the paper, told IEEE Spectrum the work has garnered a lot of interest. “These robots are soft and they can be controlled remotely,” she said. “They can also change their shape, which makes them very interesting for treatment of internal diseases.”",

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds",
      "description": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $228 at Amazon\n $329.99 $228 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $89 at Nothing\n $109 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)\nThe second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExceptional ANC\nSecure fit\nWireless charging case\n\nBulky design\nMerely average battery life\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Bose\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nThe name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen earbuds bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.\nAlthough Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.\nAs with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.\nRead our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah!

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nAirPods Pro 3\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\n\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nApple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features last year. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with (yet again) improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and more battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.\nThe new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, in combination with better ANC performance, give the AirPods Pro 3 the best overall noise canceling from a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is incredibly close to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (although some people might not even notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.\nBut what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, which we first saw with the Powerbeats Pro 2 last winter, enables heart rate tracking for 50 different types of workouts directly from the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. \nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $169 at Amazon\n $229 $169 at Best Buy\n $229 $169 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $149.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $149.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $299.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $299.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $179.99 at 9Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to add the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) and Apple AirPods Pro 3 as picks, and to reflect current pricing / availability.",

      "description": "The Apple Watch SE 3 has dropped to its best price to date in several configurations.\t\n\nHey, all! The first week of November ushered in dozens of early Black Friday deals, and many of the best ones are still available as we delve further into the weekend. Some of our favorite fitness trackers have already plunged to new lows, for instance, and we’re even seeing early discounts on holiday decor. We’ve already published a full list of early Black Friday deals, which we aim to update on a weekly basis, but below is a quick overview of this week’s cream of the crop — including a few standouts that have nothing to do with the annual shopping event.\nIt’s possible that the Apple Watch SE 3 will drop further in price once Black Friday officially kicks off, but if you don’t feel like waiting, the 40mm / GPS configuration is already down to $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Costco. That’s a new low on Apple’s latest smartwatch, which is a great value even at full price; however, note that the current Amazon promo only applies to the cream-colored “starlight” model.\nFor an entry-level wearable, the SE 3 offers several impressive features. It features an always-on display — a first for Apple’s cheaper SE lineup — and runs on the same snappy S10 chip found in the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3. That means, in addition to better performance, you’ll be able to take advantage of some of Apple’s more unique features, including on-device Siri and the new wrist flick gesture. You also get health and wellness features that were previously limited to more expensive models, including sleep apnea notifications, a wrist-temperature sensor, and ovulation tracking. Some features, such as EKG readings and blood oxygen measurements, are still reserved for the Series 11, but sacrifices are expected at this price.\nRead our Apple Watch SE 3 review.\nApple Watch SE 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199.99 at Amazon (40mm, GPS)\n $279 $229.99 at Amazon (44mm, GPS)\n $249 $199.99 at Costco (40mm, GPS)\n\nIf you’re planning to spend Thanksgiving binging the latest season of Stranger Things like me, Google’s TV Streamer (4K) allows you to experience The Upside Down in crisp, 4K resolution. And right now, it’s available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google for an all-time low of $74.99 ($25 off).\nGoogle’s latest set-top box can make your favorite shows and movies sharper and more immersive, thanks to its support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos audio. Its interface can pull content recommendations across streaming services — with Rotten Tomatoes scores — and it comes with a handy Find My feature for the remote, which lets you ping the clicker via the streaming box should you ever misplace it. The Google TV Streamer (4K) even doubles as a smart home hub with Matter and Thread support, allowing you to control your smart lights or check various camera feeds directly on your TV.\nRead our full Google TV Streamer (4K) review.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $74.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $74.99 at Best Buy\n $99.99 $74.99 at Google\n\nIf you’re already feeling the holiday spirit, Lego’s 2025 Star Wars Advent Calendar is on sale at Target for $26.99 ($18 off), which is its best price to date. The 263-piece kit includes 24 daily surprises for each day of December, with a mix of minifigures, buildable droids, and small set pieces. It includes characters like Babu Frik, C-3PO, a holiday Jawa, and hat-topped BB-8, along with eight buildable droids (including a pit droid and the infamous GNK “Gonk” power droid from 1977’s A New Hope). Some of the mini builds come together to form larger displays, too, meaning as the month goes on, you’ll be slowly assembling a workshop. Plus, once you’re finished, all the figures and builds can be combined with other Lego sets.\nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $26.99 at Target\n $44.99 at Lego\n\nThree more of this week’s best deals\nSamsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card is on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon, which is a small discount but the best we’ve seen. The card lets you store all of your digital Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 titles, but you can also use it to expand storage on certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. It supports sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, although only devices with a dedicated microSD Express slot can take advantage of the maximum speeds.\nThe Anker 521 PowerHouse is on sale for an all-time low of $128.99 at Amazon at checkout, down from $249.99. The 256Wh power station features two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet, letting you recharge phones, cameras, and laptops several times over. It can also run power-hungry devices that draw up to 300W of power, including mini fridges, and comes with a useful display that shows you how much power you have left.\nSamsung’s 65-inch Frame Pro TV is down to an all-time low of $1,447.99 ($752 off) at Woot through December 6th, while the larger 75-inch model can be had for $1,897.99 ($1,302 off). Like the standard Frame, the Frame Pro displays artwork when idle, so it looks like wall decor; however, it’s noticeably brighter and comes with a faster 144Hz refresh rate, along with a wireless One Connect Box to keep cable clutter out of sight.

The success of Democrats in New Jersey, Virginia, and Georgia in this week's elections can be seen as something of a referendum on the state of energy policy and infrastructure in the US as power grids struggle to keep up with growing electricity demand from AI data centers, electric vehicles, and domestic manufacturing. \nThese issues aren't going to disappear, and Democrats now face a tough road ahead to meet those challenges and make good on their campaign promises to lower electricity prices.\n\"Consumers have sent a clear m …\nRead the full story at The Verge.",

While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\nPutting this game into maintenance mode is an awkward counterpart after last month’s news of a 2026 multiplatform release for the Halo: Campaign Evolved remake, but that’s the way things have gone for Infinite ever since it came out of the blocks stumbling with an ugly, unpolished eight-minute gameplay trailer in 2020.\nThe game was eventually delayed another year to late 2021, missing the launch of the Xbox Series X / S consoles, and shipping without features like campaign co-op and the Forge customization mode.  The infamous Craig did get a glow-up, and subsequent updates checked off some of the community’s wishlist items. Still, it’s clearer than ever that the future of Halo is cross-platform and doesn’t include the free-to-play multiplayer of Infinite, as Xbox hardware sales continue to slow, and Microsoft’s profitability push shuts down studios and raises prices.\nNow, the team writes, “we’ve been floored by the response” to Campaign Evolved, which will be released on both PS5 and Xbox next year.",

      "title": "The best Fitbits for your fitness and health",
      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker",
      "description": "In 2025, you might wonder if Fitbit is still relevant. Despite being acquired by Google, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics, like EKGs and blood oxygen levels.\nThat said, we’re still in the transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. We’re further away from 2023, which was a particularly messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to sunset legacy community features — including challenges — or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will require you to log in via Google beginning in February 2026. \nSpeaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration started in 2023 and is required if you buy the Fitbit Charge 6 or the Google Pixel Watch 4. The Fitbit app also got a more Google-like makeover, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And last year, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company as roughly a thousand Google employees were laid off. Now, in 2025, most of Google’s focus seems to be on its own smartwatches. \nThe Googlefication of Fitbit will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale. All the devices also come with a free trial to Fitbit Premium, the company’s subscription service that provides guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. The service costs $9.99 per month, or $79.88 per year. And with the launch of the Pixel Watch 4 in October, it’s clear that Google is taking its wearables seriously as well. The new smartwatch features longer-lasting battery life, a more repairable design, and compatibility with Fitbit’s AI-powered fitness coach. You just have to go in with eyes wide open.\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nGoogle Pixel Watch 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAll-around better battery and fast-charging\nMaterial 3 Expressive design refresh is smart\nBetter auto activity tracking\nRaise-to-Talk is quite natural\nDomed display looks quite nice\nRepairability!\nSatellite SOS\n\nThird proprietary charger in four years\nGemini is still hit or miss\nGPS maps are better, but still a bit wonky\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Google (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Amazon (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Best Buy (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 doesn’t have “Fitbit” in its title, but it falls under the same umbrella because of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. The fourth-gen watch is a significant update over its predecessors, with a handsome domed display and thinner bezels that increase screen real estate. The watch’s updated design allows you to swap out the display or battery, if necessary, and we were able to eke out between 36 and 42 hours of battery life in our testing, up from 32 hours on the Pixel Watch 3. We also saw a notable uptick in charging speed, allowing us to take the watch from 14 to 97 percent in just 44 minutes using Google’s new proprietary charger.\nThe hardware upgrades work in tandem with Wear OS 6, which introduces a complete redesign with Material 3 Expressive and brings Gemini to Google’s latest wearable. A new raise-to-talk feature lets you access the smart assistant without saying “Hey Google” or pushing a button, while new AI features such as Notification Cooldown and Smart Replies — which let you compose personalized replies to incoming messages if you have a newer Pixel phone — put even more functionality on your wrist. Gemini in Wear OS 6 is somewhat hit or miss, to be sure, but the redesign complements the Pixel Watch 4’s size and shape really well.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 can automatically track a limited number of exercises, allowing you to accurately record your walks, runs, and cycling sessions. Its dual-band GPS was better at tracking runs than the Pixel Watch 3 in our initial tests, but it couldn’t quite keep up with Apple’s pricier Watch Ultra 3. That said, both LTE models share the ability to send an emergency SOS via satellite when you’re in a remote area with no signal. The Pixel Watch 4’s mix of hardware, features, and price make it the best Fitbit, and one of the top Android watches overall.\nIf all you want is a fitness tracker that looks like a smartwatch, you can consider the $199.95 Versa 4 since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the Sense 2 since the Pixel Watch 4 can do all the same things — and more.\nRead my full Pixel Watch 4 review.\nBest budget Fitbit\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood entry-level fitness & sleep tracker\nBright OLED display\nLightweight\n\n\nHuge bezels\nLimited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.95 $69.95 at Amazon\n $99.95 $69.95 at Best Buy\n $99.95 $69.95 at Google\n\nThe Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, inspired. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the Fitbit Luxe of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.\nThe Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.) \nThe Inspire 3 has a variety of accessories, including a clip attachment if you want to track steps discreetly. There’s even a gold or silver mesh strap if you want to dress it up a bit. \nRead our coverage of the Fitbit Inspire 3 here.\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nFitbit Charge 6\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSolid fitness and health tracking feature set\nIt’s $20 cheaper!\nAdds more apps\nCan broadcast HR to fitness equipment\nThe haptic button is better than the groove\n\nYouTube Music is the only option and that’s $11 monthly\nThe Fitbit-Google transition is a lil bumpy\nIt’s not a physical side button\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $159.95 $99.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $99.95 at Google\n\nThe Charge series has always been popular, and the $159.95 Charge 6 is no exception. It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive Versa 4 on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.\nThe only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.\nAltogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, Sense 2, Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Watch 4. So, unless you’re dead set on the smartwatch form factor, the Charge 6 is the better overall deal. \nCompared to its predecessor, the Charge 6 also adds an improved heart rate algorithm, Bluetooth compatibility with some gym equipment, and a few apps — namely Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music. While YouTube Music works well, I’m not stoked that it requires an additional $10.99 monthly subscription. That said, it’s better than nothing, as Fitbit discontinued onboard music a while back.\nIn terms of hardware, the Charge 6 also features a haptic button instead of an inductive groove. It’s not a physical button, which is a little disappointing, but it’s more reliable thus far than the inductive groove, so I would count this as a net positive.\nRead our Fitbit Charge 6 review.\nBest Fitbit for kids\nFitbit Ace LTE\nThe Ace LTE sports some of the same hardware found on the Pixel Watch 2 and a variety of step-activated games, which can help motivate your child to keep moving. It also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing when you sign up for a monthly or annual data plan.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat build quality for a kids’ watch\nCross platform\nFun games that require physical activity to unlock\nVoice calls and text messaging with preselected contacts\nFamily group chat\n\nYou’ll have to charge it every night\nOnly two color options (but multiple band options)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $99.95 at Amazon\n $179.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 $99.99 at Google\n\nThe $179.99 Fitbit Ace LTE isn’t really a traditional fitness tracker, though it does track active minutes. Instead, it’s a smartwatch with a mix of kid-friendly games and activities and thoughtful, family-oriented communication features. It’s a walled garden, but an adorable one.\nInstead of rigorously tracking health stats, the Ace LTE tracks “active minutes,” which fill a cute progress meter called a Noodle that runs around the face of the watch. Active minutes earn time with the Ace LTE’s built-in games that, combined with activities, unlock customizations for your kid’s avatar (called an Eejie) that lives in the watch, as well as its little house. You can also unlock different games and virtual items by connecting different watch straps.\nWith a $10/month subscription, you get real-time location tracking and both voice and text messaging to preselected contacts through the Fitbit Ace app (rather than the standard messaging and phone apps). As of November 2024, that includes other family members with Ace LTE watches, as well as a family group chat between parents and kids.\nI like that the Ace LTE is built more like a cross-platform smartwatch for adults than other kid watches we’ve used, like the plasticky Garmin Bounce. It uses the same charger as the Pixel Watch 3, and gets about a day’s worth of battery on a charge. My kids enjoy it but aren’t obsessed with it — though they have been known to run laps up and down the hallway to earn more game time. \nGoogle says the Ace LTE is best suited for kids aged 7 to 11, and that sounds right. My oldest is 10 now, and she’s been using an Ace LTE for about a year. Once she hits middle school, I think she’ll be frustrated that she can’t use it to talk to her friends. But for now, it’s great. We recently got one for our 8-year-old, and it’s wild that they can text each other from their watches. It also means my 8-year-old can spam the group chat with emoji, but that’s fine too. \n— Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nRead our hands-on with the Fitbit Ace LTE.\nShould you even buy a Fitbit right now?\nFitbit officially became part of Google in 2021. Nothing changed overnight, but technically, it’s Fitbit by Google now. The Fitbit-to-Google migration started in the summer of 2023, and account migration will be mandatory — not merely optional — for all users in early 2026. Google angered longtime Fitbit users by shuttering social features like challenges and removing streaks, though the latter returned a few months later. In early 2024 Google laid off roughly a thousand employees from its hardware departments, including people on the Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest teams.\nIn early 2025, Google released a mandatory software update for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense users to “reduce the risk of battery overheating,” which had the unfortunate side effect of reducing battery life from as many as six days to as few as one for some users. However, the fact that we’re getting a significantly redesigned Fitbit app and an AI-powered health coach does show that Google is still investing resources in projects under the Fitbit name. The hardware improvements introduced with the Pixel Watch 4 are also a positive sign that Google remains committed to developing compelling wearable hardware. \nUpdate, November 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.

      "title": "IEEE WIE Podcast Focuses on Workplace Issues for Women in Tech",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech",
      "description": "For anyone working in today’s rapidly evolving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, visibility, authenticity, and connection are no longer optional; they are essential. But there is a lack of resources for STEM professionals, especially women, looking to express themselves fully, build meaningful networks, and lead with confidence.\nTo help, IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) recently launched a podcast series in which experts from around the world inspire and inform to ignite change.\nThe series aims to amplify the diverse experiences of women from STEM fields. Through candid conversations and expert insights, the podcast goes beyond technical talks to explore the human side of innovation, navigating burnout, balancing career ambition with well-being, and building successful, sustainable careers.\nThe series is a volunteer and staff-run initiative.\n“In the early days of planning, our vision was just a spark shared among passionate volunteers eager to shape each episode and guest experience,” says Geetika Tandon, cochair of the IEEE WIE podcast subcommittee. “Seeing our podcast grow from those first conversations into a vibrant reality has been truly rewarding. We can’t wait for it to expand further.”\n“I’m excited that we’ve brought the drawings on our whiteboard and day planners to life,” says Kelly Onu, who is also cochair.\nNew episodes are released on the third Wednesday of each month.\nNavigating dual-career dynamics\nThe podcast’s premier episode, “Moms Who Innovate,” which debuted in May, features candid conversations with two executive coaches, authors, and TEDx speakers. Adaeze Iloeje-Udeogalanya, is the founder of African Women in STEM, which provides education, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Cassie Leonard is a seasoned aerospace professional who founded ELMM Coaching. Leonard offers one-on-one advice for professionals looking to grow their career and achieve a better work-life balance. She authored STEM Moms: Design, Build, and Test to Create the Work-Life of Your Dreams, a book that guides women by drawing from her experiences as a working mother.\nOnu, who moderated the episode, spoke with Iloeje-Udeogalanya and Leonard about the ebb and flow of being a mother while building a career. Both guests described how their background as engineers shaped the way they approach motherhood and community. They emphasized the importance of creating a support system that makes the busier times of life more manageable.\nLeonard said she “engineered her neighborhood” and shares the responsibilities of dropping off children at school, babysitting after school, and other day-to-day tasks.\n“As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.” —Geetika Tandon\nInnovation for moms isn’t only about professional success, the duo said, but also about designing the kind of community that helps them thrive.\nThe June episode, “Global Perspectives on Women in STEM,” led by Tandon, offered practical strategies for navigating work-life-balance challenges. Together with guest Sanyogita Shamsunder, CTO of telecommunications company GeoLinks in San Francisco, Tandon explored different perspectives of women around the world.\nRawan Alghamdi, a wireless communication researcher at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, in Saudi Arabia, and an IEEE graduate student member hosted August’s episode, “PIE Framework: Presence, Image, and Exposure for Professionals in STEM.” Alghamdi spoke with Jahnavi Brenner, an executive coach and former engineer, who explained the PIE model, which challenges the long-held belief that technical skills alone are enough to advance one’s career.\nBrenner said professionals must strategically build an authentic personal brand to dictate how they are perceived by colleagues and how visible they are within their networks and industry. She said it is especially vital for women and underrepresented groups, who often face systemic barriers to recognition and promotion.\nOctober’s episode, “Balancing Work and Life in STEM Careers,” tackled struggles parents face raising a family while working full time. It was moderated by Abinaya Inbamani, a mentor who has contributed to the successful deployment of IoT systems used for smart health care, renewable energy, and cybersecurity.\nShe covered the intense logistics and emotional toll of balancing a demanding career with the responsibilities of parenthood.\nListeners also learned time-management strategies and boundary-setting techniques, such as reframing guilt as a reminder of care and responsibility rather than failure; accepting that it’s all right to procrastinate occasionally rather than push through unhealthy stress; and organizing the day with clear boundaries between work and home.\n“We don’t have to do it all,” Inbamani said. “Sometimes balance is simply choosing what matters most in that moment.” \nWhat’s next for the podcast\nUpcoming episodes will focus on being present parents, setting boundaries in high-pressure environments, and redefining success on one’s own terms, Tandon and Onu say.\nIn the works is an episode spotlighting tech trailblazer Nimisha Morkonda Gnanasekaran, who was recognized by the IEEE Computer Society as one of its Top 30 Early Career Professionals this year. She is the director of data science and advanced analytics at Western Digital, based in San Jose, Calif.\nAnother episode, Tandon and Onu say, will feature a conversation with Cynthia Kane, author of The Pause Principle: How to Keep Your Cool in Tough Situations, on navigating difficult workplace conversations without shutting down or losing one’s temper. The episode will tackle critical issues and career struggles women face, Tandon and Onu say. A study that found as many as 50 percent of women leave their STEM career within five years.\nGlobal reach and impact of the podcast\nIEEE WIE is seeing the impact the podcast is having on listeners. Several say they tune in not just for advice but also to connect with others. Others say the podcast makes them feel they are not alone in their challenges or career aspirations.\nThe majority of listeners are in Canada, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the United States. Onu says she hopes the audience expands to include more countries.\n“I hope this podcast hops across continents, sneaks into earbuds everywhere, and becomes a trusty sidekick in women’s STEM journeys—cheering them on as they conquer equations, break barriers, and maybe even invent a robot that makes perfect coffee,” Tandon says. “As the podcast series grows, our mission is to shine a spotlight on the real-life adventures (and occasional misadventures) of women in STEM. We want to share late-night brainstorms, coffee-fueled breakthroughs, and the moment when someone finally figures out how to unmute themselves on virtual meeting platforms.”\nThrough personal tales, inspiring journeys, and a parade of trailblazing leaders who have tackled obstacles, IEEE WIE is celebrating the grit, wit, and brilliance of women in STEM.\nWhether you’re a student just beginning your STEM journey, a mid-career professional seeking clarity, or a leader looking to give back to your profession, the podcast offers a space to learn, reflect, and rise together.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-multimode-drone",
      "description": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.\nICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA\nEnjoy today’s videos!\n\n \nUnlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.\n\n[ HiPeR Lab ]\n\nI appreciate the softness of NEO’s design, but those fingers look awfully fragile.\n\n[ 1X ]\n\nImagine reaching into your backpack to find your keys. Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn’t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.\n\nMulti-university Collaboration presented via [ GitHub ]\nThanks, Haonan!\n\nHappy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!\n\n[ Pollen Robotics ]\n\nIn collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling worm robot to test in the field. See it crawls through corrugated drainage pipes in a stream, and a smooth section of a subsurface drainage system.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Smart Microsystems Laboratory, Michigan State University ]\n\nHeterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments — uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps — subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.\n\n[ SPINE-HT ] from [ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania ]\n\nAstribot keeping itself busy at IROS 2025.\n\n[ Astribot ]\n\nIn two papers published in Matter and Advanced Science, a team of scientists from the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, developed control strategies for influencing the motion of self-propelling oil droplets. These oil droplets mimic single-celled microorganisms and can autonomously solve a complex maze by following chemical gradients. However, it is very challenging to integrate external perturbation and use these droplets in robotics. To address these challenges, the team developed magnetic droplets that still possess life-like properties and can be controlled by external magnetic fields. In their work, the researchers showed that they are able to guide the droplet’s motion and use them in microrobotic applications such as cargo transportation.\n\n[ Max Planck Institute ]\n\nEveryone has fantasized about having an embodied avatar! Full-body teleoperation and full-body data acquisition platform is waiting for you to try it out!\n\n[ Unitree ]\n\nIt’s not a humanoid, but it right now safely does useful things and probably doesn’t cost all that much to buy or run.\n\n[ Naver Labs ]\n\nThis paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus’. Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.\n\n[ Paper ] from [ Autonomous Robots Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology ]\n\nHeavy payloads are no problem for it: The new KR TITAN ultra moves payloads of up to 1500 kg, making the heavy lifting extreme in the KUKA portfolio.\n\n[ Kuka ]\n\nGood luck getting all of the sand out of that robot. Perhaps a nice oil bath is in order?\n\n[ DEEP Robotics ]\n\nThis CMU RI Seminar is from Yuke Zhu at University of Texas at Austin, on “Toward Generalist Humanoid Robots: Recent Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges.”\n\nIn an era of rapid AI progress, leveraging accelerated computing and big data has unlocked new possibilities to develop generalist AI models. As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks? In this talk, I will outline our data-centric research principles and approaches for building general-purpose robot autonomy in the open world. I will present our recent work leveraging real-world, synthetic, and web data to train foundation models for humanoid robots. Furthermore, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges of building the next generation of intelligent robots.\n[ Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute ]",

      "title": "Co-Captain Allows Ships to Share Important Navigational Data",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ship-navigation-orca-ai",
      "description": "A new onboard system allows ocean-going vessels to share real-time sea condition data, giving crews early warnings and helping them navigate more safely. The system will analyze data related to navigation, vessel behavior, and the environment to give ship crews guidance at sea.\nWhile casualties from ship collisions and groundings have declined, the overall number of maritime incidents are on the rise, up 22 percent in recent years, driven by aging vessels and equipment failures.\nOrca AI, a London-based autonomous maritime navigation company, has introduced a software feature called Co-Captain, aiming to reduce those incidents. Co-Captain is an addition to the company’s existing SeaPod real-time decision support system, which bridge officers can use while at sea to navigate better.\n  Co-Captain provides information about severe weather, including recommendations to specific ships based on their size and shape.Orca AI\n“Co-Captain is a network of vessels using Orca to capture events worldwide and share insights. Think of it like the navigation app you use in your car: it tells you about traffic or roadblocks in advance so you can adjust your route,” says Yarden Gross, the CEO and co-founder of Orca AI.\nGross says that Co-Captain frequently collects data from sensors on board vessels and sends it to the cloud to improve ship performance and safety for vessels globally.\nOrca AI’s Maritime Solutions\nOrcaAI, founded in 2018 by Gross and Dor Raviv, the CTO, began with SeaPod and Fleet View. While SeaPod collects and analyzes data on individual ships, Fleet View gathers that data in the cloud to give fleet managers on shore better visibility into larger operations.\nCo-Captain integrates with the existing system to provide proactive insights to improve fleet performance and safety. Today, ship officers rely on tools like radar, the automatic identification system (AIS), and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) monitor the positions of other vessels and avoid collisions, but much of the work remains manual.\n  Co-Captain identifies various navigational hazards to a ship’s crew. The crew can also manually tag obstacles or other concerns.Orca AI\nGross described Co-Captain as the next generation of AIS, the network that transmits basic information like a ship’s position, name, and heading over very high frequency (VHF) signals ranging from 30 to 300 megahertz. Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship’s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels’ crews.\n“Every ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node—the vessel itself—has an onboard AI platform. This platform collects data from multiple sensors in real time,” Gross says. Using cameras and computer vision, the AI model can detect bad weather, low visibility, tall waves, or strong winds, then the platform analyzes the data to provide tailored guidance.\nAll data is anonymized. Gross says that a ship’s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. “By anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.”\nGross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.\nThe company’s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship’s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations. The platform is already in use on over 1,200 vessels.",

      "title": "Menifee’s EV-Powered Homes: A New Era in Energy Independence",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/evs-keep-homes-lit",
      "description": "In Menifee, Calif., six newly built homes are testing a first for North America: electric vehicles that can power houses through the Combined Charging System (CCS) high-power DC charging standard. Each home uses a host Kia EV9 electric vehicle connected to a Wallbox Quasar 2 bidirectional charger, allowing the car’s 100-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery to run essential circuits during blackouts or periods when electricity prices are high. The setup is the first residential vehicle-to-home (V2H) system in the United States that uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard. The CCS is the charging system commonly used in European and North American residential and public charging facilities.\nSince July, the homes’ smart electrical panels have automatically managed two-way power flow—charging vehicles from the grid or rooftop solar, then reversing the flow of energy when needed. The system isolates each home from the grid during an outage, preventing any current from flowing into external power lines and endangering utility crews and nearby equipment.\n“This project is demonstrating that bidirectional charging with CCS can work in occupied homes,” says Scott Samuelsen, founding director of the Advanced Power and Energy Program (APEP) at the University of California, Irvine, which is monitoring the two-year trial. “It’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people but also strengthen the energy system.”\nMenifee means a lot\nFor more than a decade, two-way charging has been available—but mostly restricted to Japan. Back in 2012 the Nissan’s LEAF-to-Home program proved the idea viable after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but that Nissan system relied on the CHAdeMO standard, little used outside of Japan. Most North American and European manufacturers chose CCS instead—a standard that, until recently, supported only one-way fast DC charging.\nThat distinction makes Menifee’s V2H-enabled neighborhood notable: it’s the first CCS-based V2H deployment in occupied homes, giving researchers real-world field data on a technology that’s been long trapped in pilot programs. The pairing of the Kia EV9 SUV with Wallbox’s commercially available Quasar 2 can deliver up to 12 kilowatts of power from the vehicle to the home.\nIt’s a step toward vehicles that not only move people, but also strengthen the energy system.”\n –Scott Samuelsen, UC Irvine\n\nElsewhere, momentum towards commercial V2H has slowed. Ford’s F-150 Lightning supports home backup through Sunrun, but Sunrun equipment is not CCS-compatible. What’s more, Ford has announced a production pause for the pickup truck, which has delayed expansion. GM’s Ultium Home—a  V2H system that works with the automaker’s Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra EVs— faces similar setbacks. Tesla’s PowerShare V2H feature is still stuck in a limited, early commercial rollout, with bidirectional compatibility restricted to the company’s Cybertruck. Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.\nWhy CCS Matters\nWhen electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).\nBidirectional operation wasn’t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS’s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations—ISO 15118—didn’t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, ISO 15118-20, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.\nWallbox’s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its 12-kW power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says Aleix Maixé Sas, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.\n  As the company’s name humbly suggests, Wallbox’s chargers look like plain old boxes—although they contain high-tech components.Wallbox\nThe Menifee blueprint\nEach of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh SunVault stationary battery from SunPower. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9’s battery. When the grid fails—or when energy prices spike—the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.\nThis past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that “the vehicle adds a major resilience feature,” according to Samuelsen, who is the Menifee project manager. “It can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.”\nEngineering the Two-Way Home\nHome builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.\nA Glimpse of the Energy Future\nAnalysts expect double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee’s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.\nWhen EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear—and with it, old concepts regarding who’s an energy supplier and who’s a customer.",

Somewhere between quarterly planning meetings and incident retrospectives, we often lose the joy of creation in our corporate jobs. Large companies require a level of bureaucracy and specialization that is often at odds with building something new.\nThat’s why I frequently recommend burned-out engineers to do something very simple: Start a side project. During 15 years working across various tech stacks and companies, this has been the most straightforward, underrated, and powerful way to regain my excitement at work.\nBeyond rekindling a passion for creation, side projects have many other benefits. Side projects let us explore new technologies or problem spaces. We can leverage newer ideas that our companies may be hesitant to adopt. And you don’t need to get buy-in from a manager or explain the business justification. Start using a technology simply because you want to learn about it. \nWhen you build something through a side project, your depth of understanding is far greater than just following a tutorial or reading about it. I can attribute many of my career opportunities to the projects I’ve built and published outside of my day job. Some of these projects, like my career growth platform Taro, even turn into companies!\nWe’ve entered the golden age for side projects because they’re so much more accessible. Compared to a decade ago, it’s significantly easier to research, build, and deploy your creation. Even compared to two years ago, you’re much less likely now to waste hours wrestling with some configuration rabbit hole. Just ask ChatGPT or Gemini for help!\nThe benefits of a personal project are real: passion, learning, career growth, and fun. And they’re easier than ever to create. Now’s the time to create your side project portfolio.\n—Rahul\nHow to Land a Job in Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry is growing, opening up new opportunities for engineers—and you don’t necessarily need a background in quantum physics to take these positions.

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud",
      "description": "Have you received a notification from your bank or credit card company alerting you to suspicious activity on your account and requesting you confirm a purchase? You probably wondered how the bank suspected the charge wasn’t legitimate.\nCredit card companies use a variety of methods to detect fraud, which is the most common type of identity theft and is on the rise, according to Experian, one of the major consumer credit information services.\nPankaj Gupta\n\nEmployer \nDiscover, in Raleigh, N.C.\nTitle \nData engineering manager\nMember grade \nSenior member\nAlma mater \nChristian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India\nTo help prevent unauthorized transactions, IEEE Senior Member Pankaj Gupta is developing tools using data integration, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time account monitoring. Gupta is a manager of data and analytics engineering for Discover, and he works from Raleigh, N.C.\n“The innovations my fraud department has developed have helped my organization respond to threats faster and adapt more easily to future needs,” he says.\nThis year, he received Discover’s President’s Award, the company’s highest employee recognition. It is given to those who have achieved outstanding business results while demonstrating the company’s values.\nGupta also became an invited member of the Forbes Technology Council, a community of experienced leaders across industries, selected based on their professional achievements and leadership experience.\nHe says he enjoys his job but says he never meant to work in financial services, a field where he has built a nearly two-decade-long career.\nFrom electrical engineering to software development\nAs a youngster, he was curious about how things worked and would take apart gadgets his father brought home.\n“My father worked at BSNL, a government telecom organization, and often took me to his office,” Gupta says. “There I would watch phones in operation and telecom operators connecting trunk calls. At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.”\nWhile at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.\nTaking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.\n“Growing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the Bamleshwari Temple, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,” he says.\nHe also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory’s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.\n“I noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,” he says. “This exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.”\nIn 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the Christian College of Engineering and Technology, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.\nIn India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company Satyam Computer Services, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor’s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.\nThat’s when he pivoted to software engineering.\nGupta says that although software development wasn’t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.\nHe still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn’t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.\nHis time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.\n“It’s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,” he says.\nUsing AI and machine learning to combat fraud\nGupta left Satyam in 2011 to join Mphasis, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for Wipro Technologies in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.\nHe moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at JPMorgan Chase in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank’s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.\n“This greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,” he says.\nHe also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.\n“I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.”\n“This allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,” he says. “These innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.”\nHe joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.\nAI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer’s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.\nIn simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.\nStaying connected to tech pros\nGupta joined IEEE in 2023 “to connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,” he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.\n“Membership has helped me access world-class research through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library,” he says. “It also provided me an opportunity to attend conferences and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.”\nAI’s impact on engineering\nHis advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.\n“Technology is changing very rapidly,” he says. “What is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.”\nHe predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.\n“Engineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,” he says. “I believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\n“Focus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.\n“Build your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.”",

      "title": "Inside Hyundai’s Massive Metaplant",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-metaplant",
      "description": "When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.\nBut dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.\n Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto\nNear the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.\n\n\n\n Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThat battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.\nThe episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.\nAutomakers roll with the punches because they have no choice\n An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto\nAs with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.\nTo have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.\nThe factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.\nClearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.\nOutside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.\n An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto\n Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto\n “Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto\nSmart, silent robots unload trucks\nWhen those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.\n An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.\nRoach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.\n Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto\nRobots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.\n Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto\n“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”\nMan’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.\n Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto\nThose four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.\n At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto\nFrom nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.\n After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto\n An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto\nIn a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars. But Hyundai and other automakers will keep trying. They don’t have any other choice.",

      "title": "Inside the Massive Effort to Sequence All of Europe’s Lepidoptera",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/lepidoptera-genome-sequencing",
      "description": "It’s a little after 6:30 on a brisk July morning in a stone hut high in the Italian Alps. A gently hissing wood fire is leaking some warmth out of a brick oven. Gathered near it, around a big wooden table, some of Europe’s brightest young lepidopterists are doing what they do best: arguing in Spanish, Italian, and English about moths.\n The Alte Pforzheimer Hütte, a stone house originally built in 1901, served as a base camp for the lepidopterists hunting rare moths in the Italian Alps.Luigi Avantaggiato\nScattered across the top of the table are dozens of moths in plastic specimen jars, the harvest of the previous night’s trapping. At one end of the table, Gioele Moro of the Czech Academy of Sciences is gently prying loose moths from the depths of a trap. At the other end, Laura Torrado-Blanco of the University of Oviedo’s entomological collection is paging through Lepidoptera guide books. She’s using the books to identify species—up here at 2,300 meters, there is no Internet connection.\n A few of the scores of moths captured on a single night at a site in the Italian Alps are lined up on a bench in the stone hut. Researchers will identify the moths’ species and some of the insects will be sent on for tissue sampling and eventual genome sequencing. Luigi Avantaggiato\nLooking up from a book, she notices me noticing the big butterfly tattoo on her left arm. “Chapman’s ringlet,” she tells me. “Erebia palarica,” she adds reflexively.\nPep Lancho Silva, a doctoral student at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, extends a finger toward me with a spectacular creature on it: a large bone-white moth, with a black head and big black splotches on its wings. Torrado-Blanco is pretty sure it’s Arctia flavia, a species of tiger moth found only in rarefied air. If so, it’s precisely the kind of insect they came up here, to this chilly hut on the edge of a crystalline Alpine pond, to capture.\n A yellow tiger moth, Arctia flavia, is among the catch at the stone hut, at an altitude of 2,300 meters. \n At the crack of dawn in the stone hut, researchers [from left] Eric Toro Delgado, Laura Torrado-Blanco, Mónica Doblas-Bajo, and Gioele Moro (standing) unpack and examine the moths captured during the previous night.Luigi Avantaggiato\nLepidopterists have trapped, identified, and classified moths and butterflies for centuries. But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It’s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of Project Psyche, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. Psyche is part of a larger effort, the Darwin Tree of Life project, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the Earth BioGenome Project. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of all of Earth’s roughly 1.8 million organisms—every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that’s made up of cells that have a nucleus.\nRelated: The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything\nNone of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it’s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal—to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035—won’t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.\n\n\n\nBut the project’s success may ultimately hinge on functions other than sequencing. For example, after a creature’s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data—consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs—must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, before an organism’s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it’s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.\nHow Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? \nWhen I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to Charlotte Wright and Joana Meier at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, England. The reasons, they tell me, span a range from pure science to completely commercial.\n \n At the Hotel Tyrol in the Italian Alps, lepidopterist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, dissects the yellow tiger moth captured near the stone hut. Packed with liquid nitrogen, the tissue samples will subsequently be sent to the institute in England for genome sequencing.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe earliest Lepidoptera appeared 250 million to 300 million years ago. By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, “we can find out how they have evolved and how they’ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.”\nThose genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell’s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature’s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the Atlas blue butterfly, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.\nThe Atlas blue is “a very good example of something that’s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,” says Meier. “What we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications”—thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. “Then we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, ‘What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that’s broken?’ ”\n Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.Luigi Avantaggiato\nAnd it’s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data. One practical aspect of these studies has to do with moths’ impact on agriculture. “There’s billions and billions of euros lost because agriculturally, some species do a lot of damage,” says Meier.\nAdds Wright, “Pests are moving to new regions where previously they weren’t present and causing huge losses because the crops there haven’t been developed to be protected against these new species.” The reasons why some species succeed in a new area as climate changes, and are able to adapt and thrive, are also understandable only by studying many genomes—of the creatures that succeed, as well as the ones that don’t. “It’s kind of a dynamic situation, of monitoring these pests’ movements,” says Wright.\n  Shortly before sunset, Gioele Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, sets up a moth trap on a mountain slope above the stone hut (the Alte Pforzheimer Hütte) in the Italian Alps.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \nThat, it turns out, takes a small army of grad students, researchers, and even citizen-scientists. Indeed, one of the goals of this expedition is to develop and refine best practices in collecting samples for genome sequencing and to train a cadre of young lepidopterists, who have varying levels of familiarity with the technologies of genome sequencing and annotation. On such techniques rests the success of not only Project Psyche, but also, ultimately, the Earth BioGenome Project.\nTo Catch a Moth, You’ve Got to Think Like One\nIt’s late in the afternoon of our first day in the high-altitude hut. Moro, of the Czech Academy of Sciences, is standing on a steeply raked mountainside in a dazzling sea of wildflowers—purple, yellow, lavender, crimson—that are gently swaying in the fading amber light. He’s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he’s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it’s black). He’s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth’s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.\nThe objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different “microenvironments,” he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there’s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.\n  Genetics researcher Noé Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.            Luigi Avantaggiato        \n“Over there”—he points across the valley to the opposite slope. “It faces north. See? No flowers. That’s what I mean by different microenvironments.” We’re perched on the south-facing slope, about 80 meters above the valley bottom, on a trail about as wide as a toaster oven.\nHours later, after dodging cow patties the size of dinner plates and gaping holes leading to marmot burrows, the locations are chosen and the traps are set. There’s one on the south slope, one on the north, and one near the fast-flowing stream between them. As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.\nAt the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night’s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they’ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The Wellcome Trust is the lead sponsor of both Project Psyche and the Darwin Tree of Life project.\n \n  Lepidopterist Joana Meier of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, packs the abdomen of a moth into a vial for shipment from Italy to the institute in England. A bar code on the vial contains information about the sample and allows it to be tracked on its journey to the lab. Luigi Avantaggiato\nThe plastic tubes are packed in liquid-nitrogen-cooled shipping containers for the trip to Wellcome Sanger. DNA begins to break down almost immediately after death, especially in soft tissues. So the cryogenics are necessary to ensure that the samples arrive at Wellcome Sanger with as little degradation as possible.\nMicromoths Are a Looming Challenge \nNiklas Wahlberg of Lund University, in Sweden, is officially a “sampling hub leader” of Project Psyche. Unofficially, he’s one of the select few grizzled veterans here in Malles Venosta helping to mentor the young researchers, whose attendance is being funded through a European Union program called European Cooperation in Science and Technology.\n  Niklas Wahlberg, an evolutionary biologist at Lund University in Sweden, captures a moth in a plastic container at a trapping site along an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nWahlberg is an unabashed fan of moths. It’s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it’s just that he’s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can’t even fly at night or in the rain. “Butterflies are just day-flying moths,” Wahlberg quips. “People think of them as different and special, but they’re not.”\nIn this new era of mass genome sequencing, they’re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera—about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 European Lepidoptera species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg’s reckoning. And they’ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.\nSo the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the micromoths.\nMicromoths have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; the smallest can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as “macromoths”). There are a lot of micromoths—at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.\n  Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.Luigi Avantaggiato\nThat’s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes. Fortunately, though, it’s a problem for which there is a technological solution: DNA barcoding.\nBesides the DNA in the nuclei of every cell, there exists other genetic material, called mitochondrial DNA, outside of the nucleus. It’s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there’s a mitochondrial gene, called CO1, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. “We have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,” Wahlberg says. “And only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.”\nDNA barcoding was invented in the early 2000s by Paul Hebert and colleagues at the University of Guelph, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.\n \n  Staﬀ Scientist Silvia Pérez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing. To minimize degradation of the DNA in the samples, they are stored at -80 °C.Luigi Avantaggiato\nGenetic material is isolated from that tissue, and then a CO1 gene is “amplified,” or replicated into many millions of copies, using a standard biotechnical technique called polymerase chain reaction. That material is sequenced using any one of the dozen or more types of sequencing machines available to researchers.\nFor barcoding purposes, typical DNA sequences of the CO1 gene run between 400 and 800 base pairs. But lately researchers have been developing techniques that use shorter or longer barcodes. The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have 100 to 250 base pairs. Conversely, “super-barcodes,” which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species—exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.\nWhy RNA Will Make Annotating Faster\nWhile the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project. Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly, Lycaena helle, a creature that was first studied in 1775. They described their efforts in a paper published by F1000Research.\nThis was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome’s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.\n  Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.Luigi Avantaggiato\nToday, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the thousands of genes within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. “You take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, ‘Ah, look here. There’s a gene that starts here,” says Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG), in Barcelona. “ ‘And this is the structure of the gene.’ And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,” of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.\nGut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or ribonucleic acid. When a gene specifies, or “expresses,” a protein, RNA acts as the “messenger,” carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.\nThe breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article “The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything, in IEEE Spectrum.”] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations—CNAG, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at Pompeu Fabra University, and the University of Barcelona—and from Andorra Research and Innovation, in Sant Julià de Lòria.\nThe genome of the female violet copper butterfly, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also very difficult to predict by computational means. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says Roderic Guigó Serra, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.\n“Long-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,” he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, “we get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,” Serra declares.\n  At the Guigò Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. Luigi Avantaggiato\nHis group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species—including humans. They’re doing this through Gencode, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, “reference” annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it—particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying 18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes. “These genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,” says Serra.\nResearchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world’s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe’s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.\nIt’s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. “My loathings are simple,” he wrote in 1973. “Stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music. My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing and butterfly hunting.”",

      "title": "This Professor’s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education",
      "description": "As an electrical engineering student in the 1980s and ‘90s, Carlotta Berry had two experiences that helped shape her future as an educator.\nFirst, while she studied robots, she wasn’t allowed to interact with them. “The robots were too expensive, so the undergrads did not get to touch them,” Berry recalls. “I said to myself, I’m going to teach engineering someday, but in a way that the students will get to touch and program the robot.”\nThis led Berry to work toward overcoming the economic exclusivity of robotics. But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. “It sometimes could be a lonely experience,” says Berry. “Representation does matter.”\nNow, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. \n  Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology\nShe also works to support people of color in engineering. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. “This was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,” says Berry, noting that today only about 8 percent of electronics engineers are women and about 5 percent are Black. “It was time for something to change.”\nBerry’s Path to Teaching\nAs a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school—especially math—and thought she’d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. “I didn’t really know what an engineer was,” she recalls. “I didn’t know anyone who was an engineer.” After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor’s in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as part of a dual degree program with Spelman College, where she earned a bachelor’s in mathematics in 1992.\nAfter her bachelor’s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master’s in electrical engineering and control systems at Wayne State University in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. “I really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,” she says. \nAfter a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at Vanderbilt University in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school—and at last found herself on the right career path: “I always wanted to be an educator,” she says. \nA Turn Toward Outreach\nBerry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.\n  Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman’s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.Griffin Museum of Science and Industry\n“As a full professor, I don’t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,” she says. “When I provide education for students and for the community, that’s also part of my research and service.” For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.\nSince 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, “to the streets.”\nBerry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from kids just a few years old to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, “visibility matters.”\nWith any audience, Berry is always “very approachable and very engaging,” says Nicki Manion, a program manager for Rose-Hulman’s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.\n“I have to go where people are,” Berry says. “I get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.”\nThis past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics—sense, plan, act—the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.\nLast year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.\nOnline Community and Writing\nBerry hasn’t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics—part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it’s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. “There were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,” she says.\nHer professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: “That was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.” In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the Society of Women Engineers and AnitaB.org.\n  Children’s books like the series Berry wrote help get kids interested in STEM.Rebellion LIT\nOn top of her outreach and community work, Berry finds time to write children’s books—work that also has its roots in the pandemic. During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children’s book she knew she had to write: There’s a Robot in My Closet. The book spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (Berry also writes STEM-centered romance novels for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of her book Elevated Inferno, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life—an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) \nWhile balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds “see themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.”",

      "title": "A Challenge to Roboticists: My Humanoid Olympics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-olympics",
      "description": "I was a little disappointed by China’s World Humanoid Robot Games.1 As fun as real-life Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is, what people really care about is robots doing their chores. This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn’t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as this article so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything—but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.\nWith that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are my Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update my Substack as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.\nCurrent State of The Art\nIn order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let’s first talk about what’s working now. What I’m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).\nThinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.\n\nNo force feedback at the wrists.2 The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don’t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.\nLimited finger control.3 It’s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot’s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.\nNo sense of touch.4 Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that’s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.\nMedium precision.5 Based on videos I’ve seen, I think we’ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.\n\nNow, on to the events!\nEvent 1: Doors\nEvent 2: Laundry\nEvent 3: Tools\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nEvent 1: Doors\nThings like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I’ve seen from anyone yet.\nBronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn’t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.\nSilver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nAdding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don’t see many round-knob self-closing doors).6\nGold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe boss fight of doors.7 You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.\nEvent 2: Laundry\nWe’re just getting started on laundry.\nBronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it’s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.8\nSilver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nI think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.\nGold Medal: Hang a men’s dress-shirt\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.\nEvent 3: Tools\nHumans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.\nBronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.9\nSilver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThe challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a ‘strong tool grasp’ for all kinds of activities, but it’s very challenging for robot grippers.10\nGold Medal: Use a key\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nA keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot’s waiting palm/gripper. Without putting the keys down, get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.\nEvent 4: Fingertip Manipulation\nWe humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.\nBronze Medal: Roll matched socks\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nRequires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.\nSilver Medal: Use a dog poop bag\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWhen I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I’m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.11\nGold Medal: Peel an orange\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nDone without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.\nEvent 5: Wet Manipulation\nIf you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don’t like being wet, but we’ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.\nBronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nMildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren’t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).\nSilver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nThis one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.\nGold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink\n   Your browser does not support the video tag. Benjie Holson\nWater, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.\nTerms and Conditions\nTo be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren’t following in the spirit of the challenge. First robot to achieve this wins the prize!\nTo claim your medallion email bmholson+olympics@gmail.com with an address for me to ship it to. If you give me a photo of your robot wearing a medal I will be tickled pink. I will also accept future challengers that are at least 25% faster than the current winner. Some medals have already been claimed; you can see the winning videos here. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.\nThanks to Jeff Bingham for advice, fact checking and cool robot videos. And thanks to my patient wife for spending an hour filming me doing silly things in a silly costume.\nNotes\n1 As far as I can tell, kickboxing was just the Unitree mini-humanoid robot, and everyone had the same code running, so… I guess it won?\n2 TRI has some pretty cool stuff with force control using a big training rig.\n3 Tesla’s Optimus has 22 degrees of freedom using cable drives (cause you can’t fit those motors in a hand). In 2008 I worked on this robot which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.\n4 Meta has been working with some in-finger vision systems which seem cool.\n5 This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. Here is a video of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional “mess with a robot” tool even for ridiculous things like this.\n6 Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You’re welcome.\n7 I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn’t public (also disqualified). Also it’s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.\n8 T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.\n9 You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.\n10 Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).\n11 Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.\nThis post originally appeared on General Robots, Benjie Holson’s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.",

      "title": "Volcanologists Turn to a High-Tech Suitcase to Study Eruptions",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/volcano-monitoring-stromboli-skate",
      "description": "When hundreds of volcanologists gathered in Geneva last July for the world’s largest volcanology conference, Italy’s Instituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) drew particular attention. INGV was presenting results from five years of very close range observations of Stromboli, one of the Mediterranean’s most monitored volcanoes. Its frequent small eruptions make it both a natural laboratory for vulcanologists and a constant safety concern for the island’s roughly 500 residents and thousands of tourists.\nThe last three years of close observations were made possible by a portable observatory called the Setup for the Kinematic Acquisition of Explosive Eruptions, or SKATE. The suitcase-sized system is packed with tech that captures eruptions at hundreds of frames per second, synchronously recording their roar and their heat.\nFilming and analyzing an explosive eruption up close for hours, while capturing data about its heat, sound, and motion, has historically been tricky and dangerous. But that’s the data scientists need to understand how eruptions work and evolve over time. SKATE makes that process both safer and simpler by autonomously recording synchronized streams of observatory data and minimizing the time researchers need to spend on a volcano’s slopes.\n“Explosive eruptions are extremely fast processes with particles the size of a truck or a grain of dust that can travel from a few meters per second to supersonic speeds,” says Jacopo Taddeucci, a senior researcher at INGV. “You need cameras shooting hundreds of frames per second and instruments that can see, hear, and feel the eruption at once to understand cause and effect.”\nAside from Stromboli, SKATE has been tested on the nearby Mount Etna, as well as on Guatemala’s Fuego and Santiaguito volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live near active volcanoes, many of which are without any monitoring system. INGV is now planning deployments on other volcanoes, including Mount Yasur in Vanuatu, known as the “Lighthouse of the Pacific” for its near continuous eruptions featuring rhythmic bursts of incandescent lava and gas.\nSKATE’s Innovative Volcanology Technology\nSKATE was assembled by Technology Equipment Engineering Solutions (TEES), an Italian manufacturer of custom scientific instruments and Dewesoft, a Slovenian company specializing in high-speed data acquisition and measurement systems. The two companies followed INGV’s specifications to pack an entire observatory into a rigid polypropylene shell on a €50,000 (about US $58,000) budget.\nSKATE is the streamlined successor to an earlier INGV prototype known as FAMoUS (Fast Multiparametric Setup), which first proved the value of combining high-speed, thermal, and acoustic sensors. But it also came with serious drawbacks: It was heavy and bulky, took a long time to install on site, and required manual triggering, which forced researchers to spend hours in hazardous zones to capture only a handful of sequences.\n  SKATE is more portable and easier to deploy than its predecessor, a system called FAMoUS.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nInside SKATE, a waterproof PC coordinates a thermal camera recording at 32 frames per second, and a high-speed camera that records bursts of footage when it detects sudden temperature spikes. Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE’s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.\n“The real challenge wasn’t plugging in cameras and sensors,” says Alessia Longo, an engineer at Dewesoft. “It was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.”\nThat data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on solar panels and replaceable batteries.\n“The creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,” says Piergiorgio Scarlato, INGV’s research director.\nModular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring\nPlaced between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli’s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. \nThe design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify sulfur dioxide emissions. It’s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano’s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.\n“Depth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,” says Scarlato “By understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.”\nOn Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs—chunks of lava flung out during an eruption—and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.\nSKATE’s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis\nSKATE isn’t a 24/7 alarm. It’s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater—such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments—to make better sense of their signals.\n  A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci\nData from SKATE is helping scientists test hypotheses about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can’t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.\nSKATE’s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent research campaign on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli’s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.\nDespite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. “Working in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,” says Scarlato. “The difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.”",

      "title": "Novel Geothermal System to Come Online in Germany",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/advanced-geothermal-germany",
      "description": "This article was originally published by Canary Media.\nEavor, an advanced-geothermal startup, says it has significantly reduced drilling times and improved technologies at its nearly online project in Germany—milestones that should help it drive down the costs of harnessing clean energy from the ground.\nIn late October, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel “closed-loop” geothermal systems in hotter and deeper locations than conventional projects can access.\n“Much like wind and solar have come down the cost curve, much like unconventional shale [oil and gas] have come down the cost curve, we now have a technical proof-point that we’ve done that in Europe,” Jeanine Vany, a cofounder and executive vice president of corporate affairs at Eavor, said from the Geothermal Rising conference in Reno, Nevada.\nEavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms—including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy—are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.\nThe industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.\nEavor’s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany \nEavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023, shortly after winning a $107 million grant from the European Union’s Innovation Fund. For its first “loop,” the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly 2.8 miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells—like tines of a fork—that each stretch 1.8 miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.\nOperations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March 2026. All told, the system will supply 8.2 megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and 64 MW of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. \nIn its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 100 days to complete—a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $100,000 a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by 50 percent.\nFor example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.\nOn top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35 percent, Vany said.\nThe Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches—like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada—are also scaling up.\nChallenges in Geothermal Drilling\nEnhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater—though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.\nBut the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.\n“While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,” Tester said. “You can get energy out of the ground; it’s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?”\nVany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the “levelized cost of heat” in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $50 and $100 per megawatt-hour thermal in the region’s volatile energy market, she said.\n“After we’ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,” Vany added. “And that’s the purpose of the Geretsried project.”",
